The refuge works to protect wildlife and habitats native to the Ohio River and its floodplain. Migratory birds and endangered freshwater mussels are among the important wildlife emphasized on the refuge. The refuge consists of twenty-two islands and four mainland tracts scattered along 362 miles of the upper Ohio River. Most of the refuge's 3440 acres of land and underwater habitat are located in West Virginia; however, Pennsylvania and Kentucky each have two refuge islands.

The district, established in 1993, manages over 10,600 acres of waterfowl production areas (WPAs) in 16 southeastern Wisconsin counties, covering some of the most important waterfowl areas of Wisconsin. The district also administers 45 conservation easements, totaling 3,000 acres, in 33 eastern Wisconsin counties. WPAs consist of wetland habitat surrounded by grassland and woodland communities.

The district includes Barron, Burnett, Dunn, Washburn, Pierce, Pepin, Polk, and St. Croix counties.  The central portion of St. Croix County, the heart of the district, is known as the Star Prairie Pothole Grasslands.  These grasslands are ranked sixth out of 26 priority grassland landscapes in Wisconsin. The district manages relatively small tracts of prairie wetland and grassland habitats known as waterfowl production areas (WPAs).  WPAs are purchased using Federal Duck Stamp dollars within the historic prairie pothole portion of the district, including southern Polk, St. Croix and Dunn counties.  After purchase, prairie wetland and grassland habitats are restored and then managed for breeding waterfowl, other migratory birds, and indigenous wildlife. The district's 40 WPAs totaling 7,000 acres are administered by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wildlife Refuge System. In addition to managing WPAs, district staff provide assistance to private landowners who wish to manage their land to benefit wildlife. The St. Croix Wetland Management District is adjacent to the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropoitan Area of two million people.
