The Refuge was established in 1964 on lands aquired by the Corp of Engineers in conjunction with the Coffeeville Lock and Dam project. The 4,218 acre refuge encompasses approximately 1,802 acres of lakes, sloughs, and creeks, 2,265 acres of bottomland hardwoods, and 151 acres of croplands and moist soil units.The refuge is divided into three units by Okatuppa and Turkey Creeks. This makes a large portion of the refuge accessable only by boat. Due to its location along the Tombigbee River, the entire refuge is subject to annual Spring flooding. The primary purpose of the refuge is to provide wood duck brood habitat and serve as a protected wintering area for waterfowl. Up to 200 broods of wood ducks are produced anually in the refuge's artificial nest boxes, and wintering waterfowl numbers can exceed 10,000. In addition, numerous neotropical migrant and wading birds benefit from management activities.  Following a successful bald eagle hacking program in the early 1990's the refuge has played host to a nesting pair of eagles each winter. During the summer months wood storks can be found resting and feeding in the back-water sloughs and moist soil units. Resident wildlife includes white-tailed deer, gray squirrels, turkey, raccoons, opossum, American alligator, and beaver.|127|False|8|AUTO-TOURING,BOATING,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PHOTOGRAPHY,PADDLING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

In 1963, Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge was established under the authority of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act for use as an inviolate sanctuary, or any other management purpose, expressly for migratory birds.  The refuge is considered to have one of the best existing wetland habitat areas along the Atlantic Coast.  The intensively managed freshwater impoundments have become important stop-over sites for spring and fall migrating shorebirds and wading birds.  Endangered and threatened species management activities provide habitat for the Delmarva fox squirrel, nesting bald eagles and migrating peregrine falcons.  Neotropical land birds passing through the area utilize the refuge's upland forested habitat during the fall and spring.  The refuge's 10,000 acres are a diverse landscape featuring freshwater and salt marshes, woodlands, grasslands, scrub-brush habitats, ponds, bottomland forested areas, a 7 mile long creek, and agricultural lands.

In 1924 the island was placed under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Biological Survey to be maintained as a preserve and breeding ground for native wildlife and migratory birds.  A presidential proclamation in 1940 changed its designation from Blackbeard Island Reservation to Blackbeard Island National Wildlife Refuge.  In 1975, three thousand acres of the refuge were set aside as National Wilderness.  Blackbeard Island was named for Edward Teach, alias Balckbeard the Pirate. Rumors of Blackbeard's buried treasure still flourish, but no evidence of his fortune has ever been discovered. The island is comprised of interconnecting linear dunes thickly covered by oak/palmetto vegetation. There are approximately 1,163 acres of open freshwater or freshwater marsh, 2,000 acres of regularly flooded salt marsh, 2,115 acres of maritime forest, and 340 acres of sandy beach. The primary objectives of the refuge are to provide wintering habitat and protection for migratory birds; provide protection and habitat to promote resident and migratory wildlife diversity; and to provide protection and management for endangered and threatened species (loggerhead sea turtle, American bald eagle, wood stork, piping plover).  Notable concentrations of waterfowl, wading birds, shorebirds, songbirds, raptors, deer, and alligators can be seen at various times of the year.|127|False|5|BOATING,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,WILDLIFE-VIEWING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

Clear streams and beaver ponds provide ideal wetland habitat for waterfowl and other wetland dependent species. Today the forest and native wildlife populations have been restored from what was originally abandoned farm land. The refuge serves as a model of forest ecosystem management for wildlife. The red-cockaded woodpecker, a native bird of the southern US, is an endangered species because the old growth pine forests it requires for nesting and roosting have been logged throughout most of its range. The refuge currently has 35 active clans (family groups). Prescribed burning and thinning are two forest management practices used to provide habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker. Many migratory bird species, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and other native wildlife benefit from these management practices.

Anglers cast a line for bass, bluegill, and crappie on Crab Orchard Lake, Devil's Kitchen Lake, Little Grassy Lake, and many smaller lakes. The Wilderness forms the southern tip of the refuge and encompasses sections of Little Grassy Lake and Devil's Kitchen Lake. Several parking lots and boat launches provide easy access to the water. Within Crab Orchard Wilderness boundaries lie dramatic sandstone outcroppings, wood-lined creeks, and potential seclusion, but there are no maintained trails. Camping is restricted to designated campsites, of which there are none in the Wilderness area (except for preexisting camps for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts).|127|False|1|WILDERNESS|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

The lake also contains largemouth bass, and a good population of lunker-size flathead catfish. An 18-inch length limit is in effect for walleyes and black bass. Fish feeders are located in Hillsboro Cove and Cottonwood Point.   Boaters will find boat ramps located around the lake at Cottonwood Point (2 ramps, 4 lanes), Hillsboro Cove, Marion Cove (2 lanes), French Creek, Durham Cove and Broken Bridge. Developed ramps provide lights and courtesy docks. There is a fee to use these ramps. The undeveloped ramps at Durham Cove and Broken Bridge are free.   Hunters at Marion Reservoir will find a mixed bag including pheasants, quail, rabbits, turkeys, and white-tail deer. Waterfowl hunters will find good populations of Canada, snow, and white-front geese as well as all species of ducks found within the Central Flyway.   The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks maintains a large percentage of the perimeter of the lake as a public hunting area. A map showing the location of this public hunting land may be obtained at the project office. The Department also maintains a waterfowl refuge at Marion Reservoir located just east of French Creek Cove that is off-limits to the public. Its boundaries are designated on the Marion Reservoir brochure and the hunting map.   |130|False|8|BOATING,CAMPING,FISHING,HIKING,PICNICKING,WATER-SPORTS,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PLAYGROUND-PARK-SPECIALIZED-SPORT-SITE|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

Located off the delta of the great Mississippi River, Breton Island actually consists of two adjacent islands (north and south) with a combined length of about three miles and a width of less than one mile. Part of a long chain of barrier islands, they comprise only a small section of Breton National Wildlife Refuge. The greater portion of the refuge consists of the Chandeleur Islands, an approximately 20-mile-long crescent of land lying north of Breton. Between Breton and Chandeleur are more islands owned by the state and managed by the refuge. Geologically young, these unstable islands were created by the erosion and reshaping of a former Mississippi River delta. On the Gulf of Mexico side of the islands you'll find low sandy beaches tapering into a maze of ponds, inlets, and saltwater marshes. Hundreds of thousands of seabirds use these islands as nesting and wintering habitat. Endangered brown pelicans have made a dramatic return under careful refuge management. Camping is not allowed.

The refuge was established in 1986 to provide for 1) conservation and management of all fish and wildlife within the refuge, 2) to fulfill the international treaty obligations of the United States with respect to fish and wildlife, and 3) to provide opportunities for scientific research, environmental education, and fish and wildlife oriented recreation, including hunting, fishing and trapping, birdwatching, nature photography, and others. The refuge is encompassed within nearly one-half million acres of hardwood swamps, lakes and bayous.   The natural floodplain of the Atchafalaya River flows for 140 miles south from its junction with the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.   The basin's dense bottomland hardwoods, cypress-tupelo swamps, overflow lakes, and meandering bayous provide a tremendous diversity of habitat for more than 200 species of resident and migratory birds and numerous other wildlife and the area has been recognized as an Internationally Important Bird Area.  The basin's wooded wetlands also provide vital nesting habitat for wood ducks, and support the nation's largest concentration of American woodcock.   Eagles, ospreys,  swallow-tailed kites, and Mississippi kites can occasionally be seen soaring overhead.  Wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, gray and fox squirrels, eastern cottontail, swamp rabbit, gray and red fox, coyote, striped skunk, and opposum inhabit the refuge, as do a small remnant population of black bears.  Furbearers found in this great swamp are raccoon, mink, bobcat, nutria, muskrat, river otter, and beaver. The lifeblood of the fishery is the basin's annual flooding and dewatering cycle.  Overflows occur during the winter and spring rains, with many areas gradually becoming dewatered during the summer and fall. Sportfishing is popular throughout the basin.  Largemouth bass, white crappie, black crappie, warmouth, bluegill, redear sunfish, and channel catfish  are the primary species sought.  More than 85 species of fish occur in the basin, and their populations frequently exceed 1,000 pounds per acre.

On the southern end of the Mississippi and Central Flyways, Lacassine National Wildlife Refuge is primarily a freshwater marsh. Lacassine refuge marshes provide feeding and resting habitat for more than 300,000 ducks and 80,000 geese. The refuge also provides habitat for many shorebirds, wading birds, marsh birds, various manmmals,and alligators. The first nesting colony of cattle egrets outside Florida was discovered here. Nesting rookeries of roseate spoonbills, and other wading birds can be found in the Lacassine Pool. Watch for armadillos, swamp rabbits, minks, otters, nutrias and American alligators. The southern portion of the refuge, south of the pipeline canal and west of Bayou Misere, has been designated Wilderness. Unlike the rest of the refuge, this area has seen relatively little impact from human activity. There are no established trails, and no camping is allowed. The 3345 acre wilderness area can be accessed by non-motorized vessel or chest waders.

Since that time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been acquiring bottomland hardwood habitat in the Pearl River Basin. On December 13, 1989, Congress authorized a boundary expansion for Bogue Chitto NWR that included an additional 8,400 acres of bottomland hardwoods in St. Tammany Parish. To date, some 36,447 acres have been placed under refuge management. The refuge is still in an acquisition phase. White-tail deer, squirrel, turkey and hog hunting and fishing is offered to the public. The endangered and threatended species found on the refuge are bald eagle, ringed-sawback turtle, gopher tortoise, inflated heelsplitter mussel, and gulf sturgeon.  Access is primarily by boat on the refuge's Louisiana side and road access is available on the refuge's Mississippi side.  In Summer 2002, a new walking trail was unveiled on the Louisiana side of the Refuge.  This 3/4 of a mile walking trail offers a unique journey into the interior of Bogue Chitto's majestic habitat. Bogue Chitto NWR is primarily composed of bottomland hardwood habitat interlaced by the Bogue Chitto and Pearl River Systems.  Numerous sloughs, bayous and lakes are located on the refuge.  Water levels fluctuate by several feet from their low point in the summer to winter/spring flood stage.  Over 90% of the refuge can be flooded during seasonal high river periods.  The mixed hardwood forest includes water oak, overcup oak, American elm, sweetgum, and swamp red maple on higher elevations and bald cypress, tupelo gum, and swamp blackgum along the wettest areas.  Mid-story in mixed hardwoods includes ironwood, arrowwood, Virginia willow and reproduction of the overstory.

The refuge is comprised of a series of barrier islands including Breton Island and all of the Chandeleur Islands in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. It was formed from the remnants of the Mississippi River's former St.Bernard Delta, which was active 2000 years ago.  The barrier islands size and shapes constantly are altered by tropical storms, wind, and tidal action.  The area above mean high tide is approximately 6,923 acres.  In 1975, the refuge was established as a National Wilderness Area.  And in 1990, an agreement with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service authorizing the service management rights and law enforcement authority on additional State of Louisiana owned lands.  The agreement increased the refuge by an additional 11,350 acres for a total of 18,273 acres. The objectives for the refuge are to provide sanctuary for nesting and wintering seabirds, protect and preserve the wilderness character of the islands, and provide sandy beach habitat for a variety of wildlife species.  Twenty-three species of seabirds and shorebirds frequently use the refuge, and thirteen species nest on the various islands.  The most abundant nesters are brown pelicans, laughing gulls, and royal, caspian, and sandwich terns.  Over ten thousand brown pelicans have been recorded nesting on the refuge.  Endangered and threatened species such as the least tern, brown pelican, and piping plover are common to the refuge.

The refuge contains 25,162 acres divided into two units.  The 6,671 acre Headquarters Unit borders nine miles of the northeast shore of Catahoula Lake, a 26,000 acre natural wetland renowned for its large concentrations of migratory waterfowl.  The 18,491 acre Bushley Bayou Unit, located 8 miles west of Jonesville, was established May 16, 2001.  This acquisition was made possible through a partnership agreement between The Conservation Fund, American Electric Power, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.  The habitat found at the refuge is primarily lowland hardwood forest subject to seasonal backwater flooding from the Ouachita, Black, and Red Rivers. White-tailed deer, small game mammals, songbirds, raptors, waterbirds, reptiles, and amphibians are commonly seen throughout the refuge.  Waterfowl are abundant during the winter. Peak waterfowl populations of 75,000 ducks have been recorded. In 1979, the Duck Lake Impoundment was created to provide 1200 acres of waterfowl habitat.  Management of the impoundment is to manipulate water levels to promote the growth of aquatic and moist soil vegetation.  In 2001, Catahoula NWR was designated a Globally Important Bird Area.  Catahoula Lake is recognized as a Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR site):  a historic concentration area for shorebirds, waterbirds, and migrating/wintering waterfowl. Catahoula NWR also borders a portion of the Dewey Wills Wildlife Management Area.

It was established in 1975 to protect bottomland hardwoods and provide wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl.  Additionally the refuge provides habitat for alligators, bald eagles, the little known Rafinesque's big-eared bat and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.   The refuge is bisected by 13 miles of Bayou D'Arbonne, a stream in the Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System, and is crisscrossed by numerous creeks, sloughs and oxbow lakes.  Cypress swamps, bottomland hardwood and upland forests complete the landscape that is habitat for a diverse group of plants and animals.  D'Arbonne NWR also has the national record mayhaw tree, a wetland species with fruit that makes delicious jelly.  D'Arbonne is one of four refuges managed in the North Louisiana Refuges Complex.        In years of normal or above rainfall, the refuge's bottomland hardwood forest is a very important overflow area for the Ouachita River basin.  High water levels, which usually occur between January and May, can flood up to 87% of the refuge. The wetland forests not only provide habitat to wetland dependent wildlife, but they also reduce damage from flooding in developed areas, they filter silt and other particles from the water, they help neutralize pollutants in the water, and they provide recharge areas for aquifers (natural underground water storage areas).|127|False|6|BOATING,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,WILDLIFE-VIEWING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

The 6,000 acre refuge is located in Avoyelles Parish outside of Marksville, Louisiana.  Prior to clearing, this productive bottomland hardwood ecosystem provided ideal habitat for forest wildlife, but the shift toward agriculture and shallow marsh has made it more attractive to a wide variety of waterfowl, wading birds, and shorebirds.  Due to its location in east-central Louisiana, the refuge is influenced by both the Mississippi and Central Flyways and the large expanses of shallow wetlands draw a diversity of waterfowl species. Although Northern pintails, mallards, wood ducks, and green-winged teal are the dominant species, blue-winged teal, northern shovelers, gadwall and American wigeon are also common during the fall and winter months.  Large numbers of snow and white-fronted geese winter on the refuge.  During the spring and summer months, a variety of migratory songbirds utilize the bayous, scattered forested tracts, and shallow marsh habitat.  Numerous native species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and insects are common residents of the refuge.

The refuge is nearly 35,000 acres in size, including  653 acres leased from the Cameron Parish School Board. The vegetation types occurring on the refuge are primarily water tolerant grasses, sedges, and shrubs.  Vegetation in the undeveloped marshes is dominated by bulltongue and maidencane. The habitat is divided into 16,500 acres of natural, freshwater marsh and open water, 16,000 acres of managed, freshwater marsh (Lacassine Pool), 2,200 acres of rice, wheat, soybean, and natural moist soil fields, 350 acres of flooded gum and cypress trees, and 350 acres of restored tallgrass prairie. Wildlife species found on the refuge are those indigenous to the marshes of coastal Louisiana. Several nesting colonies of wading and water birds such as ibis, roseate spoonbills, and egrets are found here. A large population of alligators and furbearers such as nutria and raccoon are also found on the refuge. Endangered species reported on the refuge include bald  eagles, peregrine falcons, and Louisiana black bears. Several hundred thousand ducks and geese use the refuge as wintering habitat while wood ducks, fulvous and black-bellied whistling ducks, and mottled ducks nest on the refuge during the breeding season. Recreational opportunities for refuge visitors abound! The refuge offers fishing, hunting, boating, wildlife observation, and hiking. Lacassine NWR, known for attracting thousands of pintails each winter (a peak of 300,000), has also seen the effects of the decreasing populations. The refuge hosted numbers well over 100,000 until the mid-1980's then saw the peaks reduced by half in the 1990's.

1476|Lake-Ophelia-National-Wildlife-Refuge|LA|N/A|False|31.109388|-92.137944|Lake Ophelia NWR (named for the largest water body in the area) was established in 1988 to protect the important Mississippi/Red River floodplain ecosystem. The refuge was once part of a vast bottomland hardwood wilderness. Levees have changed hydrology, but the underlying ridge/Saale topography supports a variety of habitat types. Bottomland hardwood forest, croplands, fallow fields, moist soil units, and cypress-tupelo brakes are intermixed with meandering bayous, pristine lakes, ponds, sloughs, and the Red River. This variety of vegetative communities in turn supports a diversity of wildlife. Due to its location in east-central Louisiana, the refuge is served by the Mississippi and Central Flyways. Although mallards, northern pintails, and wood ducks are the most numerous waterfowl species on the refuge, blue- and green-winged teal, northern shovelers, gadwall, and American Widgeon are also common. Primary diving ducks are scaup and ring-necked ducks. Canada, snow, and greater white-fronted geese are present, though less common. Several hundred native species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, fishes, and insects are found on the refuge. Common, though often difficult to see, species include bobcats, alligators, red and grey foxes, turkeys, mink, and otter. More frequently encountered are white-tailed deer, raccoons, fox squirrels, beaver, marsh hawks, and wading birds. Many neotropical migratory songbirds use the refuge at various times. Refuge fisheries are composed largely of largemouth bass, gar, crappie, bowfin, bream species, buffalo, carp, and catfish. Endangered species numbers are few and their presence is always marked with special interest. The arctic peregrine falcon is an occasional visitor, and thanks to the refuge's three-year bald eagle reintroduction project, bald eagle sightings are common.|127|False|6|FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION,PHOTOGRAPHY|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

All of the Wilderness is in the state of Massachusetts. In 1970 the Monomoy Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. As recently as 1958, this area was an extension of the mainland, the eroding shoreline at the elbow of Cape Cod. Severe winter storms isolated Monomoy Point from the mainland and, 20 years later, separated North Monomoy Island from South Monomoy Island. Ten miles of surf-beaten dunes on the eastern shore of the islands, still-shifting sands that sometimes reach 100 feet in height, give way to salt marsh and then to mudflats on the western shore. The ecosystem is a perfect habitat for migratory birds. Dubbed a sanctuary for wildlife in 1944, most of 7,604-acre Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge has been designated Wilderness: all of the north island and all but two tracts on the south island. The mainland portion of the refuge remains non-Wilderness. People are known to have lived here from 1711 on, and a lighthouse complex on the south island attests to their presence. Among the migratory birds you may see are grebes, shearwaters, petrels, gannets, bitterns, egrets, herons, swans, geese, ducks, and the endangered piping plover and roseate tern. Hundreds of gray and harbor seals winter along the coastline. Boaters swarm the shores in summer.

The Friends of the Assabet River NWR formed in 2000, nearly a full year prior to the transfer of the U.S. Army's former Fort Devens Sudbury Training Annex to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Since that time, the Friends Group has provided the refuge invaluable assistance in preparing to open the refuge for wildlife-dependent recreational activities by removing physical safety hazards; conducting biological surveys of vernal pools, raptors, bats, invasive plant species; and conducting numerous public outreach and education programs.  For information on becoming part of the Friends of the Assabet River NWR, contact Barbara Volkle at (508) 393-9251 or visit their website www.farnwr.org.|127|False|0||https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

The purpose of the Boyer Chute Restoration Project is to restore essential wildlife habitat that became scarce when the Missouri River was "improved" for navigation half a century ago. River channelization, wetland drainage, and conversion of river bottom floodplain areas to agricultural, industrial, and municipal uses had resulted in the loss of over 500,000 acres of habitat along the navigable stretch of the Missouri River floodplain. The Boyer Chute project is a joint Federal and local conservation partnership success story. The project has restored the area to near pre-channelization condition without affecting navigation on the main stem of the Missouri River. Boyer Chute is once again a functioning part of the river. Close to 3,350 acres of floodplain woodland, tallgrass prairie, and wetland habitats now benefit Missouri River fishes, migratory birds, endangered species, and resident wildlife. Boyer Chute is self guiding. Floods in 2011 changed the look and the habitats of the refuge. The north and south sections of the auto tour loop are open.  The Sauger Fishing Pier along the south section of road is open, but the Catfish Fishing Pier just south of the Refuge Entrance will remain closed indefinitely.

In 1975 the Brigantine Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. In 1984, to posthumously honor a New Jersey conservationist congressman, Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge (established in 1939) and Barnegat National Wildlife Refuge (established in 1967) were combined to create the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge. Although the refuge consists of more than 39,000 acres, less than 7,000 acres in the southern division (the Brigantine) qualify as Wilderness. This trailless area, a tidal wetland and shallow bay habitat, is one of the most active flyways for migratory waterbirds in North America. Birdwatchers, binoculars in hand, have zoomed in on close to 300 species, including Atlantic brant and American black duck. The Wilderness also protects Holgate and Little Beaches, two of the few remaining barrier beaches in New Jersey. Grasses on these shores stabilize the fragile dunes and safeguard the rare piping plover, black skimmer, and least tern. The refuge is open during daylight hours, but there are prohibitions on camping, fires, horses, kite flying, swimming, flower picking, or anything else that might endanger the wildlife and their habitat. During nesting season (mid-April to mid-July), the area is closed to all public use.

Roughly 25,000 years ago, where the Wisconsin Glacier reached its furthest point south and stopped, the creation of Great Swamp began. With cattail marshes, wet meadows, swamp woodlands, and ridges thick with oak, beech, and laurel, Great Swamp provides a home for 39 species of mammals including mice, moles, skunks, raccoons, otters, foxes, white-tailed deer, and the endangered Indiana bat. Migratory birds see Great Swamp as a "nest and rest" (244 species have been identified). Numerous reptiles and amphibians have taken up residence, including rare bog turtles, wood turtles, and blue-spotted salamanders. The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1960 following grassroots action to save the area from being developed into a major metropolitan airport. In 1968, the eastern half of the Refuge was designated as the very first Wilderness Area within the Department of the Interior. About 8.5 miles of primitive trails provide access during daylight hours only, and camping and picnicking are not permitted.|127|False|1|WILDERNESS|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

These efforts will provide opportunities for future generations of Americans to enjoy the spectacular concentrations of shorebirds, songbirds, raptors, and waterfowl which have made the Cape May area famous for birdwatching. These areas are considered so important that refuge lands are included in the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, a "Ramsar" Wetland of International Importance, part of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network, the Pinelands National Reserve, an Important Bird Area, within the Great Egg Harbor National Scenic and Recreational River, and a destination on the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route.|127|False|7|INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION,PHOTOGRAPHY|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

The Brigantine and Barnegat Divisions were originally two distinct refuges, established in 1939 and 1967 respectively, to provide important wintering habitat for waterfowl, especially black ducks and Atlantic brant. The Divisions were combined in 1984 under the Edwin B. Forsythe name, in honor of the late conservationist Congressman from New Jersey.  The refuge complex covers approximately 46,000 acres in three counties including Atlantic, Burlington, and Ocean. Nearly 80 percent of Forsythe Refuge is tidal salt meadow and marsh, interspersed with shallow coves and bays. Most of the remainder of the refuge acreage is woodlands dominated by pitch pines, oaks, and white cedar, with some fields which are maintained to provide habitat diversity.  More than 6,000 acres are designated as Wilderness Area. This includes Holgate and Little Beach, two of the few remaining undeveloped barrier beaches in New Jersey. These pristine sites provide critical nesting habitat for threatened piping plovers and a wide variety of other beachnesting species. Beaches and dunes provide nesting habitat for piping plovers, black skimmers and least terns. Occasionally peregrine falcons, bald eagles and osprey are seen. Each spring and fall, thousands of water birds stop at Forsythe Refuge during their long migrations.  Waterfowl, wading birds, and shore birds may be viewed from the Wildlife Drive as they feed and rest.  Refuge uplands also provide important stopover habitat for migrating passerines. Forsythe is a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site, a Wetlands of International Importance site under the Ramsar Convention, and an important birding area. It also is a part of The Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve and The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail.

1524|Montezuma-National-Wildlife-Refuge|NY|N/A|False|42.966987|-76.740909|Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge lies at the north end of Cayuga Lake, in the heart of the Finger Lakes Region of New York State. Located between Syracuse and Rochester, in Seneca and Wayne Counties, Montezuma serves as a major resting area for waterfowl and other waterbirds on their journeys to and from nesting areas in northeastern and east-central Canada. Fall peaks of Canada geese reach over 60,000 birds; in spring this number has exceeded 100,000.  Spring migration peaks of snow geese have recently exceeded 100,000 birds.  Late fall use by mallards has exceeded 100,000 birds.  Use by American black ducks in the fall often reaches 25,000. Bald eagles have resided on the refuge since 1986, first producing offspring in 1987. Several pair of osprey also nest on the refuge.  There are established nesting colonies of black terns, black-crowned night-herons, and great blue herons.  Dewatered refuge impoundments provide significant foraging habitat for shorebirds during the late summer and fall. Currently, the refuge consists of more than 8,000 acres as efforts to restore and preserve the marsh continue with the Montezuma Wetlands Complex. This project involves the Service, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, conservation organizations, corporations, and private landowners, all working together to restore and enhance wetland habitats and the populations of wetland-dependant wildlife on 36,050 acres of the former Montezuma Marsh. The Montezuma Wetlands Complex is part of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, an international agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico that seeks to restore, conserve, and enhance wetland habitats and waterfowl populations throughout North America.  The National Audubon Society recognized the Montezuma Wetlands Complex as its first Important Bird Area in New York, as well as a Globally Important Bird Area.|127|False|11|AUTO-TOURING,BOATING,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,VISITOR-CENTER,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION,PHOTOGRAPHY,PADDLING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

Today, the dam continues to provide flood protection along 67 miles of the Genesee River Valley from the village of Mount Morris to downtown Rochester where the river enters Lake Ontario.    The US Army Corps of Engineers proudly promotes stewardship of public lands and waters.  In fact, the 20 mile upstream section of the Genesee River is safe guarded by the Genesee River Protection Act of 1989, which allows the dam to hold back water only to prevent flooding. Typically, the Genesee flows freely through the dam without interference. However, when the dam is preventing flooding, the water backs up to fill Letchworth Canyon until it can be released at a rate that will not cause flooding downstream.     Mount Morris Dam and Recreation Area is a day use park that offers a beautiful setting overlooking Letchworth Canyon, known as the "Grand Canyon of the East".  Explore the Visitor Center to learn more about the dam or join us for a free ranger guided walking tour of the Mount Morris Dam.

The refuge is important in conserving the "wild" Ohio within one of our nation's busiest inland waterways. Refuge islands are gradually returning to forested conditions after years of farming, oil and gas extraction, and other activities. The refuge works to protect wildlife and habitats native to the Ohio River and its floodplain. Migratory birds and endangered freshwater mussels are among the important wildlife emphasized on the refuge. The refuge consists of twenty-two islands and four mainland tracts scattered along 362 miles of the upper Ohio River. Most of the refuge's 3440 acres of land and underwater habitat are located in West Virginia; however, Pennsylvania and Kentucky each have two refuge islands. Hiking trails are available around the refuge visitor center in Williamstown, WV and on Middle Island in St. Marys, WV. An auto tour is also available on Middle Island.

Within the eight-county district, one can travel north through the high river bluffs of Pepin County, to the prairie potholes of St. Croix County, and then to the pine barrens of Burnett County. The district includes Barron, Burnett, Dunn, Washburn, Pierce, Pepin, Polk, and St. Croix counties.  The central portion of St. Croix County, the heart of the district, is known as the Star Prairie Pothole Grasslands.  These grasslands are ranked sixth out of 26 priority grassland landscapes in Wisconsin. The district manages relatively small tracts of prairie wetland and grassland habitats known as waterfowl production areas (WPAs).  WPAs are purchased using Federal Duck Stamp dollars within the historic prairie pothole portion of the district, including southern Polk, St. Croix and Dunn counties.  After purchase, prairie wetland and grassland habitats are restored and then managed for breeding waterfowl, other migratory birds, and indigenous wildlife. The district's 40 WPAs totaling 7,000 acres are administered by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wildlife Refuge System. In addition to managing WPAs, district staff provide assistance to private landowners who wish to manage their land to benefit wildlife. The St. Croix Wetland Management District is adjacent to the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropoitan Area of two million people.

The refuge is situated in a unique geological formation known as the driftless area.  Thousands of years ago,    glaciers surrounded but did not pass over the land.  Blown into mounds, sand and silt from melting glaciers     formed the rolling sand prairies of the refuge.        Wetlands are a prominent feature.  Before the railroads arrived and the locks and dams were built,    the lands within the refuge were part of the Mississippi River.  As such, these backwaters experienced floods and     droughts.

These coastal wetlands are a significant part of the wildlife habitat and aquatic resources of the south shore of Lake Superior. The refuge was established in 1999, and it is still being created.  Its purpose is to protect, restore, and manage coastal wetland and spring-fed stream habitat. Up to 540 acres of coastal wetland in the Whittlesey Creek watershed will be acquired, and up to 1,260 acres will be protected through conservation easements. Restoration of coaster brook trout, an anadromous fish native to Lake Superior, is one of the refuge goals. The refuge will also restore stream and wetland habitat to benefit other fish species and migratory birds. The refuge is located immediately north of the Northern Great Lakes Visitor Center, which is operated by the Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, Wisconsin State Historical Society, University of Wisconsin Extension Service, and Friends of the Center Alliance, Ltd.
