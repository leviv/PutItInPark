Check out some of the major rockwork done on some of the trails! The Klondike Bluffs Trail System has two sections Klondike North and Klondike South.  The southern section is about  17 miles from Moab and the northern section is a few miles beyond that.  Both have signs.  The trails are a mixture of tough climbs and descents and smooth fast singltrack working along some of the uplifted rocks in the area.  Very fun, especially in cooler weather. There is no fee to ride the Klondike Bluffs Trails, however the BLM, the USFS, Grand County Trail Mix and all the local riders would appreciate if you keep these trails nice by staying on them, cleaning up after yourself and others and not riding them if it is too muddy.

16459|Silver-Reef-Mining-District|Utah|Zion|False|37.252778|-113.367778|Silver Reef Mining DistrictJohn Kemple arrived in Harrisburg in 1866, and boarded at the Orson Adams House for the winter. Kemple was an experienced prospector, and in 1868 he found a mineralized sandstone float (an ore unattached to the bedrock) that assayed very high in silver, but he had a hard time pinpointing its source. He returned in 1870, and discovered silver in the White Reef, at the Southern base of Pine Valley Mountain. But because the silver was in sandstone, which at the time was considered impossible, assayers were skeptical of his findings, which slowed the process for locating the source of his supplies. In 1874, John Kemple took the lead in organizing a new mining district called the Harrisburg Mining District, and Orson B. Adams was elected president. The first claim recorded within this district, was only about 300 hundred yards southwest from the Orson Adams House and was named Pride of the West Ledge and Kemple Company. Two years later, by early 1876, a surge of silver fever took off, and miners, along with supporting industries, flowed into the area.With the closest railroad a 100 miles away in Milford, on-site transformation of silver ore into bullion was crucial. The nearest mills were more than 300 miles away, so it was decided to build mills near the mines, process the ore, and then ship finished bullion to the railroad by wagon. Three of the five mills were built in Silver Reef, with one in Leeds and the other on the Virgin River, named Stormont Mill. Mines that would not pay before the mills came were now considered valuable property. During 1876, Silver Reef was one of the largest towns in Washington County, with about 1,500 residents. A development boom took place along mile-long Main Street, including the construction of 6 saloons, 9 grocery stores, 2 dance halls, a brewery, a billiard hall, the Wells Fargo Express Office, a jail, and a church, amongst many others. St. John Catholic Church was Southern Utah’s first established Catholic congregation, founded in 1879, which housed the town’s hospital in a rear wing. Only remnants of the church can still be seen. Town advocates wanted Silver Reef to become the county seat, but the more conservative citizens of neighboring towns, established by members of the LDS church, were against it.  As a typical boomtown, Silver Reef grew as quickly as it dwindled down. Reduced operations continued through 1909, after which mining completely stopped, and livestock owners took their place. When the town went extinct, neighboring town residents burrowed the leftover buildings and took the materials for their own use.|126|False|1|PHOTOGRAPHY|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

By following the East Fork of the Virgin River, you can hike over ten miles through the canyons into the east side of Zion National Park. Bear in mind to check with the Park concerning fees. Also, the Park currently maintains a research area immediately downstream of the WSA that is closed to backcountry use. The northern half of Parunuweap is heavily wooded with pinyon and juniper with a jeep trail leading down into the canyon. This route should only be taken by people experienced in driving on rough mountain roads. The main landmarks in and directly south of the southern portion of the WSA are Harris Mountain and Elephant Butte. Again, springs and plant life concentrate animals in the area. Mule deer are common, and with the mule deer come predatory mountain lions. Many kinds of hawks, eagles and other birds can also be seen in the area. Beware, however, since rattlesnakes are also common here. Special Features: A major historical feature is the Elephant Gap or Foote Ranch Road, believed to follow the pioneer route between Pipe Spring, Arizona, and Long Valley, Utah. About 4.5 miles of this route are cherry-stemmed from the WSA and 4 miles are considered to be a way within the WSA.   The state sensitive bald eagle occasionally roosts in the WSA in the winter.

1308|Blackbeard-Island-National-Wildlife-Refuge|GA|N/A|False|31.630045|-81.285686| Blackbeard Island  was acquired by the Navy Department at public auction in 1800 as a source of live oak timber for ship building. In 1924 the island was placed under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Biological Survey to be maintained as a preserve and breeding ground for native wildlife and migratory birds.  A presidential proclamation in 1940 changed its designation from Blackbeard Island Reservation to Blackbeard Island National Wildlife Refuge.  In 1975, three thousand acres of the refuge were set aside as National Wilderness.  Blackbeard Island was named for Edward Teach, alias Balckbeard the Pirate. Rumors of Blackbeard's buried treasure still flourish, but no evidence of his fortune has ever been discovered. The island is comprised of interconnecting linear dunes thickly covered by oak/palmetto vegetation. There are approximately 1,163 acres of open freshwater or freshwater marsh, 2,000 acres of regularly flooded salt marsh, 2,115 acres of maritime forest, and 340 acres of sandy beach. The primary objectives of the refuge are to provide wintering habitat and protection for migratory birds; provide protection and habitat to promote resident and migratory wildlife diversity; and to provide protection and management for endangered and threatened species (loggerhead sea turtle, American bald eagle, wood stork, piping plover).  Notable concentrations of waterfowl, wading birds, shorebirds, songbirds, raptors, deer, and alligators can be seen at various times of the year.|127|False|5|BOATING,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,WILDLIFE-VIEWING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

Clear streams and beaver ponds provide ideal wetland habitat for waterfowl and other wetland dependent species. Today the forest and native wildlife populations have been restored from what was originally abandoned farm land. The refuge serves as a model of forest ecosystem management for wildlife. The red-cockaded woodpecker, a native bird of the southern US, is an endangered species because the old growth pine forests it requires for nesting and roosting have been logged throughout most of its range. The refuge currently has 35 active clans (family groups). Prescribed burning and thinning are two forest management practices used to provide habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker. Many migratory bird species, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and other native wildlife benefit from these management practices. The diversity of habitats provides a haven for nearly 200 species of birds and 50 species of mammals.|127|False|7|AUTO-TOURING,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,VISITOR-CENTER,WILDLIFE-VIEWING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

The 10,053-acre refuge includes beaches with rolling dunes, maritime forest, and vast salt marshes.  The refuge is bordered by the Wilmington River and Wassaw Sound on the north, the Vernon River and Ossabaw Sound on the South, and the Atlantic Ocean on the east.  Salt marsh and tidal creeks separate the refuge from the mainland and Skidaway Island to the west.        Refuge visitors may enjoy recreational activities such as birdwatching, beachcombing, hiking and general nature studies.  The 20 miles of dirt roads on Wassaw Island and seven miles of beach provides an ideal wildlife trail system for hikers.  Birdwatching is particularly fruitful during the spring and fall migrations.        The island supports rookeries for egrets and herons, and a variety of wading birds are abundant in the summer months.

1381|Driftless-Area-National-Wildlife-Refuge|IA|N/A|False|43.031723|-91.174686|The "driftless area" of the Upper Midwest derives its name from the fact that it was unglaciated during the most recent glacial event about 12,000 years ago. Glaciers surrounded but did not pass over this land. Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1989 to protect the Federally endangered Iowa Pleistocene snail and threatened northern monkshood plant. Habitats that support these species are also home to other glacial-relict snail and plant species that require specific cool moist conditions to live. These species occur only on algific talus slopes or moist sandstone cliffs. In these fragile places, constant cold air exiting from a cliff or talus slope creates a unique microclimate, one that may be considerably different from areas only meters away. The refuge is currently 775 acres, consisting of nine units in four counties in northeastern Iowa. When the proposed acquisition is completed, at least 70 percent of the known northern monkshood population and 75 percent of the known population of the Iowa Pleistocene snail will be protected.

1280|Atchafalaya-National-Wildlife-Refuge|LA|N/A|False|30.321699|-89.937221|Atchafalaya NWR, about 30 miles west of Baton Rouge, Louisiana and one mile east of Krotz Springs, Louisiana lies just east of the Atchafalaya River.  The refuge was established in 1986 to provide for 1) conservation and management of all fish and wildlife within the refuge, 2) to fulfill the international treaty obligations of the United States with respect to fish and wildlife, and 3) to provide opportunities for scientific research, environmental education, and fish and wildlife oriented recreation, including hunting, fishing and trapping, birdwatching, nature photography, and others. The refuge is encompassed within nearly one-half million acres of hardwood swamps, lakes and bayous.   The natural floodplain of the Atchafalaya River flows for 140 miles south from its junction with the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.   The basin's dense bottomland hardwoods, cypress-tupelo swamps, overflow lakes, and meandering bayous provide a tremendous diversity of habitat for more than 200 species of resident and migratory birds and numerous other wildlife and the area has been recognized as an Internationally Important Bird Area.  The basin's wooded wetlands also provide vital nesting habitat for wood ducks, and support the nation's largest concentration of American woodcock.   Eagles, ospreys,  swallow-tailed kites, and Mississippi kites can occasionally be seen soaring overhead.  Wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, gray and fox squirrels, eastern cottontail, swamp rabbit, gray and red fox, coyote, striped skunk, and opposum inhabit the refuge, as do a small remnant population of black bears.  Furbearers found in this great swamp are raccoon, mink, bobcat, nutria, muskrat, river otter, and beaver. The lifeblood of the fishery is the basin's annual flooding and dewatering cycle.  Overflows occur during the winter and spring rains, with many areas gradually becoming dewatered during the summer and fall. Sportfishing is popular throughout the basin.  Largemouth bass, white crappie, black crappie, warmouth, bluegill, redear sunfish, and channel catfish  are the primary species sought.  More than 85 species of fish occur in the basin, and their populations frequently exceed 1,000 pounds per acre.  Red swamp crawfish and white river crawfish are also important for both a sport and commercial harvest.|127|False|4|BOATING,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg
1312|Bogue-Chitto-National-Wildlife-Refuge|LA|N/A|False|30.321699|-89.937221| On June 30, 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed Public Law 96-288 authorizing the 40,000-acre Bogue Chitto National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Washington and St. Tammany Parishes, LA, and Pearl River County, MS. Since that time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been acquiring bottomland hardwood habitat in the Pearl River Basin. On December 13, 1989, Congress authorized a boundary expansion for Bogue Chitto NWR that included an additional 8,400 acres of bottomland hardwoods in St. Tammany Parish. To date, some 36,447 acres have been placed under refuge management. The refuge is still in an acquisition phase. White-tail deer, squirrel, turkey and hog hunting and fishing is offered to the public. The endangered and threatended species found on the refuge are bald eagle, ringed-sawback turtle, gopher tortoise, inflated heelsplitter mussel, and gulf sturgeon.  Access is primarily by boat on the refuge's Louisiana side and road access is available on the refuge's Mississippi side.  In Summer 2002, a new walking trail was unveiled on the Louisiana side of the Refuge.  This 3/4 of a mile walking trail offers a unique journey into the interior of Bogue Chitto's majestic habitat. Bogue Chitto NWR is primarily composed of bottomland hardwood habitat interlaced by the Bogue Chitto and Pearl River Systems.  Numerous sloughs, bayous and lakes are located on the refuge.  Water levels fluctuate by several feet from their low point in the summer to winter/spring flood stage.  Over 90% of the refuge can be flooded during seasonal high river periods.  The mixed hardwood forest includes water oak, overcup oak, American elm, sweetgum, and swamp red maple on higher elevations and bald cypress, tupelo gum, and swamp blackgum along the wettest areas.  Mid-story in mixed hardwoods includes ironwood, arrowwood, Virginia willow and reproduction of the overstory.  Typical mid-story plants along the sloughs and bayous are buttonbush, swamp privet, and water elm. The Refuge offers hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, hiking, primitive streamside camping, birding, photography and canoeing.|127|False|9|BOATING,CAMPING,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PHOTOGRAPHY,PADDLING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

It was established in 1975 to protect bottomland hardwoods and provide wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl.  Additionally the refuge provides habitat for alligators, bald eagles, the little known Rafinesque's big-eared bat and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.   The refuge is bisected by 13 miles of Bayou D'Arbonne, a stream in the Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System, and is crisscrossed by numerous creeks, sloughs and oxbow lakes.  Cypress swamps, bottomland hardwood and upland forests complete the landscape that is habitat for a diverse group of plants and animals.  D'Arbonne NWR also has the national record mayhaw tree, a wetland species with fruit that makes delicious jelly.  D'Arbonne is one of four refuges managed in the North Louisiana Refuges Complex.        In years of normal or above rainfall, the refuge's bottomland hardwood forest is a very important overflow area for the Ouachita River basin.  High water levels, which usually occur between January and May, can flood up to 87% of the refuge. The wetland forests not only provide habitat to wetland dependent wildlife, but they also reduce damage from flooding in developed areas, they filter silt and other particles from the water, they help neutralize pollutants in the water, and they provide recharge areas for aquifers (natural underground water storage areas).|127|False|6|BOATING,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,WILDLIFE-VIEWING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

The boundary of the refuge has been interpreted to be those areas in this vicinity that are above    mean high tide.         For a number of years, there has been only one islet at this location. This islet is composed    almost entirely of shell fragments. It is extremely dynamic and builds or recedes with passing storms.    Vegetation is almost entirely lacking. Birds known to nest here include royal terns, sandwich terns, black    skimmers, and laughing gulls. In addition, the islet is used at various times as a loafing area by white pelicans,    brown pelicans, and various other species of terns and gulls. Recent hurricanes and storms have eroded the    island to such an extent that no nesting has occurred since 1992.

Established in 1980, the refuge is one of seven national wildlife refuges in the Theodore Roosevelt National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The primary habitat feature is Mathews Brake, the largest brake in Leflore County. Each winter the brake provides habitat for over 30,000 ducks. Neotropical migratory birds use the refuge during migration seasons throughout the year. The refuge supports about 200 species of migratory birds, including priority species such as the <b>prothonotary warbler</b>. This little cavity nester is a species of concern in other areas, but has plenty of habitat around the wooded waters of Mathews Brake. Refuge staff manage the water level in the brake to promote moist-soil plants and to sustain oak trees around the edges for migratory birds. Other habitat types include 422 acres of bottomland hardwoods and 186 acres of young hardwood plantations. Hunting and fishing are the most popular programs on the refuge.

Marine invertebrate and fish communities support a complex food web from waterfowl to fish-eating birds, to marine mammals. Waterfowl use of the Refuge peaks from October through April. Over 20,000 ducks have been documented on the refuge during one survey. Over 25 species of waterfowl, along with numerous other waterbirds, depend on Oyster Bay for survival. The most common marine mammals at the refuge are harbor seals - which have become more noticeable during recent years. Sea turtles and diamondback terrapins can also be sighted at the Refuge.          New York State's only remaining commercial oyster farm operates on the refuge, producing 90% of the State's oyster harvest.|127|False|3|BOATING,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg
1821|Mount-Morris-Dam-and-Recreation-Area|NY|N/A|False|42.697733|-77.905869|The US Army Corps of Engineers built the Mount Morris Dam in the late 1940s to reduce flooding on the lower Genesee River.  Today, the dam continues to provide flood protection along 67 miles of the Genesee River Valley from the village of Mount Morris to downtown Rochester where the river enters Lake Ontario.    The US Army Corps of Engineers proudly promotes stewardship of public lands and waters.  In fact, the 20 mile upstream section of the Genesee River is safe guarded by the Genesee River Protection Act of 1989, which allows the dam to hold back water only to prevent flooding. Typically, the Genesee flows freely through the dam without interference. However, when the dam is preventing flooding, the water backs up to fill Letchworth Canyon until it can be released at a rate that will not cause flooding downstream.     Mount Morris Dam and Recreation Area is a day use park that offers a beautiful setting overlooking Letchworth Canyon, known as the "Grand Canyon of the East".  Explore the Visitor Center to learn more about the dam or join us for a free ranger guided walking tour of the Mount Morris Dam.  Spend time outside on the park grounds to enjoy captivating overlooks, picnic shelters, and a playground.  This is a great place to hike, bike, or view wildlife.

3957|Shawangunk-Grasslands-National-Wildlife-Refuge|NY|N/A|False|41.6517|-74.2106|Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge is one of New York's top 10 areas for grassland dependent migratory birds. This exceptional habitat was formerly the Galeville Military Airport. In 1994, the U.S. Department of Defense determined it longer needed the site. It was subsequently transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1999.        The refuge is 566 acres.  It is located in the valley below the Shawangunk Mountains near the Hamlet of Wallkill in the Town of Shawangunk, Ulster County, New York.  Visitors are rewarded with spectacular views of the Shawangunks as well as many species of grassland birds.        This is an unstaffed satellite of the Wallkill River NWR.  Call 973-702-7266 for more information.        Keeping this grassland and controlling the invasion of weeds, woody shrubs, and trees is the highest management priority for the refuge. Even though human created, this grassland is increasingly important for grassland-dependent migratory birds.          As part of its management strategy, the refuge strives to restore and expand the habitats of six species of declining migratory birds that currently or historically occupied the refuge.  Bobolink, Savannah sparrow, Grasshopper sparrow, Upland Sandpiper, Northern Harrier, and Short-eared Owl are the focus of refuge management.|127|False|2|HIKING,WILDLIFE-VIEWING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

The 60-acre refuge is located in the Town of North Sea on the north shore of Long Island's south fork. The refuge protects grasslands, oak-beech forest, shrub habitats, kettle holes, freshwater marsh and saltmarsh. The refuge grasslands are a habitat model for maritime grasslands, a disappearing habitat type on Long Island due to development. Maritime grasslands are native grasslands composed of little bluestem grass, switch grass, poverty grass, hairgrass, and Prickly pear cactus. Wildlife on the refuge is as diverse as its habitats.  Waterfowl are primarily black ducks and bufflehead. The grasslands are being managed and enlarged specifically to attract grassland dependent birds such as grasshopper sparrow, eastern meadowlark, savannah sparrow and bobolink. Due to its coastal location, the refuge is heavily used by migratory songbirds, shorebirds and raptors. The refuge also supports endangered and threatened species.|127|False|0||https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

Project land extends northward into Kansas, ending near Arkansas City. The lake covers 17,000 surface acres and has 168 miles of shoreline at the normal elevation of 1010.00 feet above sea level. Ground breaking ceremonies were held in May 1966 and impoundment of the reservoir occurred in 1976. Construction on the recreation facilities concluded in July of 1980 with the completion of the Osage Cove Public Use Area.   There are nine public use areas and two lake access points located around the lake for visitors to enjoy. Campers can select from over 300 family campsites, many of which are equipped with water and electric hookups. Groups of all types enjoy four group camping areas, three of which are located at the Osage Cove Public Use Area and one located at the Sarge Creek Cove Area. Use of the group camping areas is by reservation only. Interested parties can contact the Kaw Lake Office for reservations. Ten boat launching ramps provide boaters with easy access to Kaw Lake. Once on the water, boaters can find two full service marinas located at McFadden Cove and Pioneer Park. Swimmers are invited to enjoy designated swimming areas at Pioneer Park and Sandy Park.   Kaw Lake and the Arkansas River have long been known for producing some of Oklahoma's largest catfish. Kaw Lake also offers anglers excellent opportunities to catch crappie, sand (white) bass and walleye. Hunters' skills are tested with excellent populations of whitetail deer, turkey, quail, rabbit and squirrel. During the fall waterfowl seasons Kaw Lake often attracts large numbers of migrating ducks and geese.   One of Kaw Lake's most popular winter attractions is the American Bald Eagle. Traditionally, Kaw Lake has one of the states largest populations of wintering bald eagles. Numerous sites around the lake offer visitors excellent opportunities to view our nation's symbol. Peak viewing usually occurs shortly after the first of the year and lasts through January.   Hikers and horseback riders are attracted to the beautiful trails along Kaw Lakes eastern shore. The Eagle View Hiking Trail is approximately 12 miles long and runs between Osage Cove and Burbank Landing. The Five Fingers Equestrian Trail extends from Burbank Landing to the Sarge Creek Cove Public Use Area. Users should be aware that both trails are closed during Oklahoma's deer rifle and primitive firearms seasons.

Leopold is perhaps best known as the author of A Sand County Almanac, a book compiled of essays written on his farm in central Wisconsin.  In tribute to his philosophy, the Leopold Wetland Management District is dedicated to preserving, restoring, and enhancing wildlife habitat in Wisconsin for the benefit of present and future generations. The district, established in 1993, manages over 10,600 acres of waterfowl production areas (WPAs) in 16 southeastern Wisconsin counties, covering some of the most important waterfowl areas of Wisconsin. The district also administers 45 conservation easements, totaling 3,000 acres, in 33 eastern Wisconsin counties. WPAs consist of wetland habitat surrounded by grassland and woodland communities. While WPAs are managed primarily for ducks and geese, they also provide habitat for a variety of other wildlife species such as non-game grassland birds, shorebirds, wading birds, mink, muskrat, wild turkey, and deer.|127|False|7|BOATING,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HUNTING,VISITOR-CENTER,ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION,PHOTOGRAPHY|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

Within the eight-county district, one can travel north through the high river bluffs of Pepin County, to the prairie potholes of St. Croix County, and then to the pine barrens of Burnett County. The district includes Barron, Burnett, Dunn, Washburn, Pierce, Pepin, Polk, and St. Croix counties.  The central portion of St. Croix County, the heart of the district, is known as the Star Prairie Pothole Grasslands.  These grasslands are ranked sixth out of 26 priority grassland landscapes in Wisconsin. The district manages relatively small tracts of prairie wetland and grassland habitats known as waterfowl production areas (WPAs).  WPAs are purchased using Federal Duck Stamp dollars within the historic prairie pothole portion of the district, including southern Polk, St. Croix and Dunn counties.  After purchase, prairie wetland and grassland habitats are restored and then managed for breeding waterfowl, other migratory birds, and indigenous wildlife. The district's 40 WPAs totaling 7,000 acres are administered by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wildlife Refuge System. In addition to managing WPAs, district staff provide assistance to private landowners who wish to manage their land to benefit wildlife. The St. Croix Wetland Management District is adjacent to the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropoitan Area of two million people.  St. Croix County is the second fastest growing county in Wisconsin and has the highest per capita income.

Welcome to     Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge!        This 6,200-acre refuge lies within the Mississippi flyway, along the Mississippi River in western Wisconsin. It is an isolated backwater, cut off from the Mississippi and Trempealeau rivers by dikes, providing needed resting and feeding areas for waterfowl and other birds.        The refuge is situated in a unique geological formation known as the driftless area.  Thousands of years ago,    glaciers surrounded but did not pass over the land.  Blown into mounds, sand and silt from melting glaciers     formed the rolling sand prairies of the refuge.        Wetlands are a prominent feature.  Before the railroads arrived and the locks and dams were built,    the lands within the refuge were part of the Mississippi River.  As such, these backwaters experienced floods and     droughts.  Today, using dikes and control structures, managers can mimic this natural cycle by lowering the water    to expose mudflats and allow plants to germinate.
