The Refuge was established in 1964 on lands aquired by the Corp of Engineers in conjunction with the Coffeeville Lock and Dam project. The 4,218 acre refuge encompasses approximately 1,802 acres of lakes, sloughs, and creeks, 2,265 acres of bottomland hardwoods, and 151 acres of croplands and moist soil units.The refuge is divided into three units by Okatuppa and Turkey Creeks. This makes a large portion of the refuge accessable only by boat. Due to its location along the Tombigbee River, the entire refuge is subject to annual Spring flooding. The primary purpose of the refuge is to provide wood duck brood habitat and serve as a protected wintering area for waterfowl. Up to 200 broods of wood ducks are produced anually in the refuge's artificial nest boxes, and wintering waterfowl numbers can exceed 10,000. In addition, numerous neotropical migrant and wading birds benefit from management activities.  Following a successful bald eagle hacking program in the early 1990's the refuge has played host to a nesting pair of eagles each winter. During the summer months wood storks can be found resting and feeding in the back-water sloughs and moist soil units. Resident wildlife includes white-tailed deer, gray squirrels, turkey, raccoons, opossum, American alligator, and beaver.|127|False|8|AUTO-TOURING,BOATING,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PHOTOGRAPHY,PADDLING|https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg

The river currently supports 64 rare and imperiled plant and animal species, 13 of which are found nowhere else in the world.  The river has more fish species at 131 than any other river it's size in North America.  Three and one-half miles of the Cahaba lie within the approved acquisition boundary.  The rolling uplands surrounding the river are forested with mountain longleaf and loblolly pines.  Mixed upland hardwood species line ravines and the river's edge. The largest known stand of the imperiled shoals lily (known locally as the Cahaba lily) also occurs within the Refuge.

All of the Wilderness is in the state of Georgia. In 1975 the Blackbeard Island Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. In wilderness, you can enjoy challenging recreational activities and extraordinary opportunities for solitude. In an age of  "...increasing population, accompanied by expanding settlement and growing mechanization,..."  you play an important role in helping to  "...secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness"  as called for by Congress in the <a href="http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/documents/publiclaws/PDF/16_USC_1131-1136.pdf">Wilderness Act of 1964</a>. Please follow the regulations in place for this area, and use <a href="http://www.lnt.org/programs/principles.php">Leave No Trace techniques</a> when visiting to ensure protection of its unique natural and experiential qualities. <b>Regulations:</b><br>Motorized equipment and equipment used for mechanical transport are generally prohibited on all federal lands designated as wilderness.
