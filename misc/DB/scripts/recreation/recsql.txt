The upland desert landscape of the Flat Top-Peach Valley area provide outstanding off-highway vehicle riding for enthusiasts. Visitors to Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area can also check out cultural resources, including prehistoric rock art and historic mines.  The Gunnison Gorge Wilderness offers a wild and pristine backcountry experience, with its unique black granite and colorful sandstone double-canyon system carved by the Gunnison River. Fourteen miles of the Gunnison River flow through this wilderness area, offering diverse and abundant recreation opportunities. The Gunnison Gorge Wilderness now contains a total of 17,700 acres and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. All of the Wilderness is in the state of Colorado. In 1999 the Gunnison Gorge Wilderness became part of the now over 109 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. In wilderness, you can enjoy challenging recreational activities and extraordinary opportunities for solitude. In an age of  "...increasing population, accompanied by expanding settlement and growing mechanization,..."  you play an important role in helping to  "...secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness"  as called for by Congress in the Wilderness Act of 1964. Please follow the regulations in place for this area, and use Leave No Trace techniques when visiting to ensure protection of its unique natural and experiential qualities. For more information, contact the Gunnison Gorge NCA or Uncompahgre Field Office. How to follow the seven standard Leave No Trace principles differs in different parts of the country (desert vs. Rocky Mountains).

The Adams house is open sporadically for public visitation with the assistance of volunteer docents.

In the late 1870s, Mormon colonists had been sent by church leaders to pioneer new settlements along Arizona’s Little Colorado River.  As the new settlements were remote and isolated, many goods and services could only be obtained from the established Mormon communities of southern Utah.   After 1877, the Arizona Mormon settlers also traveled to St. George, Utah to conduct church business and have their marriage vows solemnized in the newly-completed St. George Temple.  So many newlyweds traveled the wagon road that it came to be known as “the Honeymoon Trail”.Couples would travel in small groups for safety and companionship to make this long-distance trek across the varied and rugged terrain of northeastern Arizona and southwestern Utah.   This journey typically began in mid-November and required many weeks of hard travel to complete.   The wagons jolted across deep dry washes and slick rock, bogged down in deep sandy soils, and became mired in muddy stream crossings.   At Lee’s Ferry, John D. Lee and his wife Emma provided regular ferry service for travelers, at one of the few feasible crossings of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.   Their journey then took them to Kanab, Utah, south to Pipe Springs, Arizona, finally heading north into Washington County.  Here, the Honeymoon Trail followed Fort Pearce Wash and headed north through the Warner Valley into St. George.  The spring at the historic Fort Pearce site was a popular overnight camping spot for these travelers, some of whom inscribed their names and the dates of their visits on the rocky cliff faces at the spring.   After their marriage ceremonies, the newlyweds would often spend the winter months in St. George, enjoying the social activities of this established community and purchasing needed supplies.  They began the long trip home in the early spring.  The Honeymoon Trail continued in use well into the 20th century, when modern highways were finally constructed across northeastern Arizona.','126',False);

The agreement increased the refuge by an additional 11,350 acres for a total of 18,273 acres. The objectives for the refuge are to provide sanctuary for nesting and wintering seabirds, protect and preserve the wilderness character of the islands, and provide sandy beach habitat for a variety of wildlife species.  Twenty-three species of seabirds and shorebirds frequently use the refuge, and thirteen species nest on the various islands.  The most abundant nesters are brown pelicans, laughing gulls, and royal, caspian, and sandwich terns.  Over ten thousand brown pelicans have been recorded nesting on the refuge.  Endangered and threatened species such as the least tern, brown pelican, and piping plover are common to the refuge.

River channelization, wetland drainage, and conversion of river bottom floodplain areas to agricultural, industrial, and municipal uses had resulted in the loss of over 500,000 acres of habitat along the navigable stretch of the Missouri River floodplain. The Boyer Chute project is a joint Federal and local conservation partnership success story. The project has restored the area to near pre-channelization condition without affecting navigation on the main stem of the Missouri River. Boyer Chute is once again a functioning part of the river. Close to 3,350 acres of floodplain woodland, tallgrass prairie, and wetland habitats now benefit Missouri River fishes, migratory birds, endangered species, and resident wildlife. Boyer Chute is self guiding. Floods in 2011 changed the look and the habitats of the refuge. The north and south sections of the auto tour loop are open.  The Sauger Fishing Pier along the south section of road is open, but the Catfish Fishing Pier just south of the Refuge Entrance will remain closed indefinitely.

Kemple was an experienced prospector, and in 1868 he found a mineralized sandstone float (an ore unattached to the bedrock) that assayed very high in silver, but he had a hard time pinpointing its source. He returned in 1870, and discovered silver in the White Reef, at the Southern base of Pine Valley Mountain. But because the silver was in sandstone, which at the time was considered impossible, assayers were skeptical of his findings, which slowed the process for locating the source of his supplies. In 1874, John Kemple took the lead in organizing a new mining district called the Harrisburg Mining District, and Orson B. Adams was elected president. The first claim recorded within this district, was only about 300 hundred yards southwest from the Orson Adams House and was named Pride of the West Ledge and Kemple Company. Two years later, by early 1876, a surge of silver fever took off, and miners, along with supporting industries, flowed into the area.With the closest railroad a 100 miles away in Milford, on-site transformation of silver ore into bullion was crucial. The nearest mills were more than 300 miles away, so it was decided to build mills near the mines, process the ore, and then ship finished bullion to the railroad by wagon. Three of the five mills were built in Silver Reef, with one in Leeds and the other on the Virgin River, named Stormont Mill. Mines that would not pay before the mills came were now considered valuable property. During 1876, Silver Reef was one of the largest towns in Washington County, with about 1,500 residents. A development boom took place along mile-long Main Street, including the construction of 6 saloons, 9 grocery stores, 2 dance halls, a brewery, a billiard hall, the Wells Fargo Express Office, a jail, and a church, amongst many others. St. John Catholic Church was Southern Utah’s first established Catholic congregation, founded in 1879, which housed the town’s hospital in a rear wing. Only remnants of the church can still be seen. Town advocates wanted Silver Reef to become the county seat, but the more conservative citizens of neighboring towns, established by members of the LDS church, were against it.  As a typical boomtown, Silver Reef grew as quickly as it dwindled down. Reduced operations continued through 1909, after which mining completely stopped, and livestock owners took their place. When the town went extinct, neighboring town residents burrowed the leftover buildings and took the materials for their own use.','126',False);

The district includes Barron, Burnett, Dunn, Washburn, Pierce, Pepin, Polk, and St. Croix counties.

In addition to managing WPAs, district staff provide assistance to private landowners who wish to manage their land to benefit wildlife.

Welcome to     Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge!        This 6,200-acre refuge lies within the Mississippi flyway, along the Mississippi River in western Wisconsin. It is an isolated backwater, cut off from the Mississippi and Trempealeau rivers by dikes, providing needed resting and feeding areas for waterfowl and other birds.        The refuge is situated in a unique geological formation known as the driftless area.  Thousands of years ago,    glaciers surrounded but did not pass over the land.

It sits atop the Arctic Circle, with approximately a third of the refuge above that meridian and two-thirds below. The refuge is a prime example of Alaska''s boreal ecosystem, which is dominated by black and white spruce with some white birch and poplars. The region''s typically short, hot summers give rise to numerous thunderstorms and lightning strikes. This results in a continuous cycle of burn and recovery.  Natural wildfires create diverse habitats with different plant species, and levels of maturity within each species.  The resulting mosaic of habitat types supports a variety of wildlife. The refuge''s migratory fish, chinook, chum and coho salmon, as well as sheefish, are creatures of extremes. Its Sheefish make the longest spawning journey of any of their species'' population on record, while Kanuti''s salmon travel more than 1000 miles up the Yukon before entering the Koyukuk River system to spawn. Refuge waters support twelve other fish species, including arctic grayling and northern pike. Protecting breeding habitat for migratory birds is central to the mission of Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Nearly 130 species of birds spend part or all of the year on refuge lands. With the loss of wetlands in regions outside of Alaska, the importance of Kanuti as a nesting area for birds is likely to increase. The refuge''s boreal forest is home to 37 species of mammals, including brown and black bears, several wolf packs, moose, wolverine, beavers, muskrats, marten and mink.

Portions of the Gulkana River were designated for its wild character as part of the National Wild and Scenic River system. The BLM asks that all users do their part to help maintain the wild character of the Gulkana through low impact camping techniques.    Seasons and Climate    The Gulkana River running season generally begins in early to mid-June, depending on ice breakup and precipitation. Average annual precipitation is 11 inches of rain and 48 inches of snow. July is commonly the wettest month. Summer temperatures range from 35 F to occasional highs in the 80s. Be prepared for cold, wet weather at any time. By mid-September, shorter days and colder temperatures bring the river-running season to a quick end.    History and Prehistory    The initial seven-mile stretch of the Middle Fork of the Gulkana River is within the Tangle Lakes Archaeological District. This area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Several known prehistoric sites are located within the corridor. The Ahtna Indians were the earliest known humans to use the Gulkana River. Around 1910, miners used the West Fork and the Middle Fork routes to reach the Denali Mining District, about 80 air-miles to the west.  NOTE: Collection or disturbance of any historic or prehistoric remains is against the law.     Vegetation and Wildlife      Spruce-hardwood forest is the major vegetation type along the Gulkana River. You may see white and black spruce, birch, aspen and popular forests. The understory includes willow, alder, rose, dwarf birch, cranberry, blueberry, Labrador tea, dwarf dogwood, lichens and mosses.   Depending on location, you may see grizzly bear, black bear, moose, caribou, beaver, coyote, otter, bald eagles, kingfishers, and assorted waterfowl. There are more than 33 species of mammals and 59 species of birds known to live in the Gulkana River basin.    Fish    The Gulkana River''s abundant fish makes it one of the most popular sportfishing rivers in Alaska. Its tributaries contain rainbow trout/steelhead, arctic grayling, king salmon (chinook), red salmon (sockeye), whitefish, longnose suckers, and lamprey. The surrounding lakes have good populations of lake trout, burbot and whitefish.   You can purchase an Alaska fishing license and view sportfishing regulations online at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game website or buy in person from license agents throughout the state, including stores in Glennallen, Delta Junction and Tok.

The refuge was established in 1991 and was named after the late Dr. Archie Carr, Jr., in honor of his extraordinary contribution to sea turtle conservation. The Refuge is a direct result of Dr. Carr bringing attention to the world''s declining turtle populations due to over-exploitation and loss of safe habitat. The refuge was designated to protect habitat for what is the most significant area for loggerhead sea turtle nesting in the Western Hemisphere, and the most significant area for green turtle nesting in North America. This represents 25-35% of all loggerhead and green sea turtle nests in the US. It also serves as a minor nesting area for the leatherback turtle, which is one of the world''s largest and rarest sea turtles. The long stretches of quiet, undisturbed sandy beaches, with little or no artificial light, are essential to the reproductive success and survival of the 15,000 to 20,000 sea turtles nesting annually. The 248-acre refuge is also unique for its placement within a patchwork of protected lands and among properties that have already been developed. To help preserve this globally important nesting ground the Service has established a partnership with State and County governments and private conservation groups to acquire and manage this dune habitat. The primary management thrust is to provide long term protection of this habitat for sea turtles and other listed species as well as providing compatible public use. Collaboratively, this partnership, known as the Archie Carr Working Group has protected over 900 acres and continues to educate thousands of residents and visitors about the unique characteristics of the barrier island ecosystem.','127',False);

Scenic Wildlife Drive provides access along the southern edge of the Wilderness, where you can expect summer temperatures in the 90s and winter temperatures in the 70s. Humidity is almost always high, and afternoon rain showers are common in the summer. Mosquitoes and no-see-ums can be abundant at times, especially in the summer.

A prominent sandy ridge distinguishes Seahorse Key, recalling the island''s past life as a huge sand dune (granted this was hundreds of thousands of years ago). The ridge crests at 52 feet above sea level, making it the highest point on Florida''s Gulfcoast. The other keys barely make it to 20 feet above the waves.

Beginning in 1952, she summered on Southport Island, where she studied its beach and tide pools to research The Edge of the Sea (1955).         Through tireless investigation for her greatest work, Silent Spring (1962), she linked the unrestrained use of post-World War II chemical pesticides with fearsome, biological consequences.  Overcoming industry and government pressure to abandon her research, she persevered.  Carson simply and convincingly explained the connections between humans and all creatures of the Earth.  She alerted generations to use chemicals with    utmost caution, warning that their improper use has dreadful effects on public health and the environment.          Rachel Carson died in 1964, a victim of cancer.

In locations where we have acquired enough land and are not affecting preferred conditions of adjacent private lands, we are allowing the river to enter its floodplain.  This occurs during minor flood events.  We have created side channels, cut down levees, and allowed the floodplain vegetation to return. Currently, in many places the refuge is an impenetrable thicket of young trees and vegetation, but, as the trees grow and the refuge matures, its appearance will change.  The process may take decades or even centuries, but we are committed to the future benefit of fish and wildlife resources in the Missouri River floodplain.  Come grow with us.','127',False);

During the Pleistocene Epoch, this area and most of northwestern Nevada, was covered by ancient Lake Lahontan. Over the last 10,000 years, the level of ancient Lake Lahontan fluctuated widely, at times drying up completely. When above water, the Grimes Point area would have been marshland with a wide variety of wetland plants and animals available for use by prehistoric populations. Grimes Point was first visited by Native Americans perhaps 8,000 years ago or more. Grimes Point is a field of basalt boulders that are covered with a glossy black patina, commonly called desert varnish. Many of the boulders are covered with pecked or carved rock art called petroglyphs. The antiquity of many of the petroglyphs can be evidenced by how varnish has completely repatinated the carved surfaces. Visitors today can view examples of petroglyphs along a 1/4 mile, self-guided interpretive trail. The trail was originally constructed by the Youth Conservation Corps and named Nevada''s first National Recreation Trail in 1978.  Handicapped accessible restrooms and picnic facilities are available at this popular stop on U.S. Highway 50. Contact the BLM Carson City District Office at (775) 885-6000 for more information or to arrange for a guided tour of the site for school or other large groups. Guided public tours are also available at nearby Hidden Cave on the second and fourth Saturday of each month. Check out the Churchill County Museum in Fallon and the Nevada State Museum in Carson City for additional displays about prehistoric Nevada and Grimes Point and Hidden Cave. Please stay on the trail and help ensure this special place remains for future generations by respectfully viewing the petroglyphs. Take nothing but photographs. Please do not touch, chalk, create rubbings of the petroglyphs, or damage them in any way.  Hidden Cave is an archaeological site which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1972, as part of Grimes Point. The cave itself was formed around 21,000 years ago by the waves of rising Pleistocene Lake Lahontan. In the mid-1920''s, the cave was found by four school boys, the first 20th century humans to do so. The cave has been excavated by archaeologists three times: once in 1940, again in 1951, and finally a large excavation in 1979-1980 by the American Museum of Natural History. A high proportion of the artifacts found in Hidden Cave were unbroken and arranged in concentrations. That led to the conclusion that 3,500 to 3,800 years ago people used the cave more as a cache (a place to store objects for later) than for habitation.  The BLM gives free public tours of Hidden Cave on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month with the exception of any three day weekend where the Friday or Monday is a federally recognized holiday, like Memorial Day, Thanksgiving, and Labor Day. The tours begin at the Churchill County Museum in Fallon, at 9:30 a.m. with a special video showing, and then the group caravans out to Hidden Cave and walks up the trail to the cave entrance. The tours end by 12:00 p.m. Additionally, tours for private groups can be arranged to be given at other times by docents from the Churchill County Museum. If you plan to visit Hidden Cave, please wear sturdy walking shoes, bring water, and dress appropriately for the weather (it can change in a hurry during every season). Hidden Cave can only be accessed through taking a scheduled tour. The site is on a 1/2 mile interpretive loop trail that is not handicapped accessible. The tour may not be suitable for very young children because of its length and the climb up the hill.','126',True);

Here in summer you''ll find thousands of terns and brown pelicans, and black skimmers flying with their black and red bills gaping to skim food from the surface of the ocean and estuaries. Hundreds of herons and egrets pace on long legs looking for food, and the beaches stir under the feet of godwits, whimbrels, and dowitchers.

Because of its unique geographic location along the Atlantic Coast which provides overlapping ranges for both northern and southern species, biodiversity is high. Habitats include barrier island beach and dunes, shrub-scrub, woodlands, farm land and freshwater marsh. Since 1939, 4,600 acres of Back Bay waters, surrounding the original Refuge lands, have been closed to migratory bird hunting by Presidential Proclamation. Today, the Refuge continues to be an important link in the chain of national wildlife refuges along the Atlantic Flyway. More than 300 species of birds have been observed at the Refuge. During the fall and winter months, large flocks of waterfowl use the Bay and freshwater impoundments. The snow and Canada goose, tundra swan, and many duck species are abundant. Migrating songbirds and shorebirds arrive at the Refuge each spring and fall. Brightly colored warblers dot shrub and woodland areas while shorebirds search for food in shallow waters. Habitats are also used by a wide assortment of other wildlife, including such threatened and endangered species as the loggerhead sea turtle.','127',False);

Refuge staff manage this barrier island habitat to allow many species of wildlife to coexist, each establishing their own place in the environment. In fact, more than 320 species of birds are known to occur on the refuge. The refuge has been designated a Globally Important Bird Area, is part of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network and designated as one of the top ten birding Hotspots by the National Audubon Society. Refuge management programs restore threatened and endangered species such as the Delmarva Peninsula fox squirrel, the bald eagle and the piping plover. More than 2,600 acres of man-mademarshes, or moist soil management units, are managed for wintering waterfowl and shorebirds during migration. Unique residents of the island, the famous Chincoteague ponies, are housed in two areas on the refuge through a special agreement with the ponies'' owners, the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. With approximately 1.4 million visits a year, Chincoteague NWR is one of the most visited refuges in the nation. Chincoteague NWR provides visitors with extraordinary educational and recreational opportunities. In addition, a special partnership exists with the National Park Service which allows Assateague Island National Seashore to administer public activities on a five-mile portion of the refuge beach.
