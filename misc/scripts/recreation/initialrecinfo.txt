It is the remnant of a volcanic plug that pushed up through the crust, and due to the relative hardness of the basalt of which it is made, has eroded significantly slower than the surrounding mancos shale and sandstone that makes up many of the rocks in the area. Needle Rock Trail is a 0.8 mile lightly trafficked out and back trail located near Crawford, Colorado that offers scenic views and is rated as moderate. The trail offers a number of activity options and is best used from March until October. For more information, please contact the Uncompahgre Field Office.|126|True

Recreation on this reservoir is managed by the SD Department of Game, Fish and Parks for the Bureau of Reclamation and includes campgrounds, boat ramps, fishing pier and a marina.  Fish species include walleye, bass, northern pike, perch, bluegill, and crappie.Because the reservoir is located on the southeastern edge of the Black Hills and is the only large body of water in an isolated area of arid southwestern South Dakota, it is attractive to migrating waterbirds that follow the eastern edge of the Black Hills.  The lake also provides habitat for migrant passerine species that travel along the Cheyenne River on their twice-yearly flights to and from the north and the west.  The best birding area is along the undeveloped western side.The area is open year-round and an entrance fee is required year-round.

All of this wilderness is located in Utah and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness is bordered by the Cottonwood Forest Wilderness to the north.The approximately 11,700 acre Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness is within the newly-designated Red Cliffs National Conservation Area and shares a common boundary with the Cottonwood Forest Wilderness, located on the Dixie National Forest. Here, massive blocks of Jurassic age Navajo Sandstone have been eroded by wind and water, leaving rounded domes and numerous small canyons. The resulting landscape is both austere and intimate, affording outstanding opportunities for solitude and natural quiet, just minutes away from the major population centers of Washington County. Convenient trail access makes this wilderness a popular choice for hikers and equestrians. Visit the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area web page for more information about trails in the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness.  Although it is at the western edge of the Colorado Plateau, the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness supports plant and animals species that typify the arid Mojave Desert. Pockets of desert shrubs cover the sand dunes and rocky outcrops of this wilderness. Mojave Desert species, such as Utah agave, banana yucca, scrub oak , and single-leaf ash, are found in the lowlands and line the dry washes. At higher elevations, pinyon pine and Utah juniper dot the rocky slopes of the wilderness area. Mule deer, mountain lion, bobcat, and kit fox live here, as they do farther east on the Colorado Plateau. Mojave Desert species, including the federally-listed threatened Mojave Desert tortoise and the Gila monster and chuckwalla reptiles are also residents of the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness. Golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, and the western screen owl circle the craggy canyons of this wilderness area, searching for prey.

16459|Silver-Reef-Mining-District|Utah|Zion|False|37.252778|-113.367778|Silver Reef Mining DistrictJohn Kemple arrived in Harrisburg in 1866, and boarded at the Orson Adams House for the winter. Kemple was an experienced prospector, and in 1868 he found a mineralized sandstone float (an ore unattached to the bedrock) that assayed very high in silver, but he had a hard time pinpointing its source. He returned in 1870, and discovered silver in the White Reef, at the Southern base of Pine Valley Mountain. But because the silver was in sandstone, which at the time was considered impossible, assayers were skeptical of his findings, which slowed the process for locating the source of his supplies. In 1874, John Kemple took the lead in organizing a new mining district called the Harrisburg Mining District, and Orson B. Adams was elected president. The first claim recorded within this district, was only about 300 hundred yards southwest from the Orson Adams House and was named Pride of the West Ledge and Kemple Company. Two years later, by early 1876, a surge of silver fever took off, and miners, along with supporting industries, flowed into the area.With the closest railroad a 100 miles away in Milford, on-site transformation of silver ore into bullion was crucial. The nearest mills were more than 300 miles away, so it was decided to build mills near the mines, process the ore, and then ship finished bullion to the railroad by wagon. Three of the five mills were built in Silver Reef, with one in Leeds and the other on the Virgin River, named Stormont Mill. Mines that would not pay before the mills came were now considered valuable property. During 1876, Silver Reef was one of the largest towns in Washington County, with about 1,500 residents. A development boom took place along mile-long Main Street, including the construction of 6 saloons, 9 grocery stores, 2 dance halls, a brewery, a billiard hall, the Wells Fargo Express Office, a jail, and a church, amongst many others. St. John Catholic Church was Southern Utah’s first established Catholic congregation, founded in 1879, which housed the town’s hospital in a rear wing. Only remnants of the church can still be seen. Town advocates wanted Silver Reef to become the county seat, but the more conservative citizens of neighboring towns, established by members of the LDS church, were against it.  As a typical boomtown, Silver Reef grew as quickly as it dwindled down. Reduced operations continued through 1909, after which mining completely stopped, and livestock owners took their place. When the town went extinct, neighboring town residents burrowed the leftover buildings and took the materials for their own use.|126|False

By following the East Fork of the Virgin River, you can hike over ten miles through the canyons into the east side of Zion National Park. Bear in mind to check with the Park concerning fees. Also, the Park currently maintains a research area immediately downstream of the WSA that is closed to backcountry use. The northern half of Parunuweap is heavily wooded with pinyon and juniper with a jeep trail leading down into the canyon. This route should only be taken by people experienced in driving on rough mountain roads. The main landmarks in and directly south of the southern portion of the WSA are Harris Mountain and Elephant Butte. Again, springs and plant life concentrate animals in the area. Mule deer are common, and with the mule deer come predatory mountain lions. Many kinds of hawks, eagles and other birds can also be seen in the area. Beware, however, since rattlesnakes are also common here. Special Features: A major historical feature is the Elephant Gap or Foote Ranch Road, believed to follow the pioneer route between Pipe Spring, Arizona, and Long Valley, Utah. About 4.5 miles of this route are cherry-stemmed from the WSA and 4 miles are considered to be a way within the WSA.   The state sensitive bald eagle occasionally roosts in the WSA in the winter.   The peregrine falcon may nest within the WSA.   The golden eagle may also sometimes inhabit or nest in the WSA.   Other state sensitive or USFWS candidate or threatened animal species that may inhabit the WSA include ferruginous hawk, Mexican spotted owl, western yellow-billed cuckoo, and Bell's vireo.

Approximately 1.2 miles of two tributaries to the North Fork of the Virgin River also flow through the Deep Creek Wilderness and have been designated as “wild” rivers.  Deep Creek North Wilderness contains numerous drainages: Crystal Creek, Big Oak Wash, Deep Creek, and several unnamed drainages. The area just outside the Deep Creek North Wilderness is dotted with springs. This extensive cover, availability of water, and a contiguous landscape of wildlands, creates habitat for a wide variety of animals.  Mule deer, elk, mountain lion, and bobcat are the larger animals that make a home here.  Just a few of the smaller mammals include badgers, marmots, and ringtail.  Numerous birds species can be observed in the wilderness with some of the more interesting being golden eagle, screech owl, chukar partridge, and wild turkey.

16386|Red-Cliffs-Archeological-Site|Utah|Zion|False|37.22343859|-113.3996061|The Red Cliffs Archaeological Site houses the remains of structures from when the Ancestral Puebloans were residing there intermittently from about 500 A.D. to 1200 A.D.  The occupation spanned three distinct periods in Ancestral Puebloan history: Basketmaker III, Pueblo I, and Pueblo II.  It is common to find habitation from these periods along water sources, in this case Quail Creek, where farming of maize and other crops was possible. One or two families lived together in pithouses, and later in multi-roomed surface pueblos. The families at this site were primarily sedentary farmers, cultivating small fields along the creek, but would also gather native plants and hunt. After 1200 A.D. the Ancestral Puebloans abandoned this site, possibly due to prolonged drought periods and climate change.BLM archaeologists excavated this site between 1977 and 1979, assisted by Youth Adult Conservation Corps youth crews. Data from the Red Cliffs site provided knowledge about the Ancestral Puebloan culture and way of life in southwestern Utah, which scientists only had very little familiarity with at the time. Many artifacts were recovered, including stone tools and pottery, which are now curated at the museum at Southern Utah University. |126|False

16399|Flying-Monkey-Trail|Utah|Zion|False|37.24020749|-113.1848299|Recommended Users: Mountain Bikers, Hikers. Singletrack trail. 2.53 miles in length. Difficulty: Extremely difficult. From the trailhead, the trail immediately drops down a steep, rugged slope and careens toward the cliff edge on your right.  Follow the narrow, winding track southeast as it traverses the crumbling layers of sandstone, siltstone and mudstone below the mesa rim. Expect a steep, rocky descent along the entire trail, with sharp turns, sudden drop-offs and precipitous exposure. Keep in mind that entire sections of the trail may be washed out in places due to its location on a steep, eroded slope. The trail becomes braided in several sections, allowing users to choose one of several interconnected paths on their descent.If you have time to look up, you’ll be rewarded with dramatic vistas of colorful badlands in the foreground, Gooseberry Mesa to the south, the craggy peaks of Canaan Mountain Wilderness to the southeast and the majestic West Temple of Zion National Park to the east.While keeping your eyes on the trail, you will experience a speedy ride-through tour of local geology. The trail begins in the Chinle Formation of the Upper Triassic Age atop the mesa then descends quickly through the Moenkopi layer of the Lower Triassic, a blur of red sandstone under your tires.  Soon after, you are plummeting through talus from the Holocene to upper Pleistocene Age before revisiting the Moenkopi Formation near the bottom of the escarpment.Once the trail drops to rolling lowlands and levels out, find your way back to SR 9 near Virgin by following the well-traveled dirt road south.   Note: This trail should only be considered by expert mountain bicyclists. Throughout its length, it features narrow tread width, widely variable and unpredictable tread surfaces, 20% or more average trail grade, jumps, unavoidable obstacles, loose rocks and extreme exposure. There are no convenient places to stop or turn around and the cost of a mistake in many places could result in serious injury or death.

Adams House    The St. George Field Office has completed rehabilitation of a mid-19th century Mormon pioneer residence for adaptive re-use.  This small sandstone masonry house was built in 1863 for the Orson B. Adams family, in the now abandoned Mormon agricultural settlement of Harrisburg, located approximately 15 miles north of St. George.   Critical to the successful completion of the rehabilitation project were partnerships with Washington County, the Utah Heritage Foundation, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation; technical assistance from the Utah State Historic Preservation Office; and volunteer labor during several phases of the project.  The Adams house is open sporadically for public visitation with the assistance of volunteer docents.      In 2004, Washington County, Utah State University (USU), and the Utah Chapter-American Society of Landscape Architects worked with BLM to create a conceptual plan for public recreation use of the 215 acres that surround the Adams house.  Quail Creek flows through the tract, creating a lush riparian area with tall cottonwood trees and willows. Other historic Harrisburg structures, terraced gardens, an orchard, fields outlined by native rock walls, irrigation ditches, and wagon roads are preserved on the property.  Students and faculty from USU documented the features of this still-intact 19th century agrarian landscape, as part of the first Historic American Landscape Survey conducted in Utah.  The final concept plan will integrate the Adams house with a system of linked hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails that connect to trails in the Red Cliffs Recreation Area, the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, and the nearby historic Silver Reef mining district.    Based on the conceptual plan, BLM completed an environmental assessment for the proposed development of a non-motorized trail system and an equestrian trailhead.

Exploration parties were immediately sent by church leaders to identify locations suitable for colonization along the Old Spanish Trail, to gain political control of the most important travel corridor in the Intermountain West.   In October of 1847, Jefferson Hunt, who had served in the Mormon Battalion in California, led a group of 18 men, 130 pack mules, and a single wagon to southern California to buy cattle, seed grain, and other needed goods.   The party arrived in San Bernardino after 45 days of travel, having reportedly brought the first wagon over the Old Spanish Trail.  The success of this expedition encouraged others to follow, including large numbers of prospectors and merchants “rushing” to the newly-discovered gold deposits at Sutter’s Mill in northern California during the winter months when the passes of the high Sierras would be impassable.  Over time, the wagon road that developed was labeled on maps as the “Old Southern Road”, the “Immigrant Road” or the “Old Mormon Road”.

16454|Honeymoon-Trail|Utah|Zion|False|37.058373|-113.306355|The Honeymoon Trail During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a primitive wagon road was the principle travel route between the Mormon settlements in northeastern Arizona and southern Utah.   In the late 1870s, Mormon colonists had been sent by church leaders to pioneer new settlements along Arizona’s Little Colorado River.  As the new settlements were remote and isolated, many goods and services could only be obtained from the established Mormon communities of southern Utah.   After 1877, the Arizona Mormon settlers also traveled to St. George, Utah to conduct church business and have their marriage vows solemnized in the newly-completed St. George Temple.  So many newlyweds traveled the wagon road that it came to be known as “the Honeymoon Trail”.Couples would travel in small groups for safety and companionship to make this long-distance trek across the varied and rugged terrain of northeastern Arizona and southwestern Utah.   This journey typically began in mid-November and required many weeks of hard travel to complete.   The wagons jolted across deep dry washes and slick rock, bogged down in deep sandy soils, and became mired in muddy stream crossings.   At Lee’s Ferry, John D. Lee and his wife Emma provided regular ferry service for travelers, at one of the few feasible crossings of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.   Their journey then took them to Kanab, Utah, south to Pipe Springs, Arizona, finally heading north into Washington County.  Here, the Honeymoon Trail followed Fort Pearce Wash and headed north through the Warner Valley into St. George.  The spring at the historic Fort Pearce site was a popular overnight camping spot for these travelers, some of whom inscribed their names and the dates of their visits on the rocky cliff faces at the spring.   After their marriage ceremonies, the newlyweds would often spend the winter months in St. George, enjoying the social activities of this established community and purchasing needed supplies.  They began the long trip home in the early spring.  The Honeymoon Trail continued in use well into the 20th century, when modern highways were finally constructed across northeastern Arizona.|126|False
