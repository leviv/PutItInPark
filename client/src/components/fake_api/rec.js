      'The Magnificent Seven Trail System (Mag 7) is a very popular new trail system just north of Moab.  The system of trails run back and forth along the unique and popular Gemini Bridges Road.  Bikers run all sorts of trips on these trails from small to large loops, to downhill epics that link up the Gemini Road and the Moab Canyon Paved Bike Path or the Golden Spike Trail and the Portal Trail all the way into Moab!  Truely fun riding and truely great views of Bull Canyon, Gemini Bridges and the LaSal Mountains! The Mag 7 Trail System includes approximately 45 miles of marked trail most of which is singletrack.  There are several loops that are possible and several different one way trips of varying "epicness" ending in Moab.  Several shuttle companies in Moab are more than happy to shuttle riders to the top of the trail or riders a little extra time can provide their own vehicle shuttle.  This map from the Grand County Trail Mix Website provides more detail on specific route options:  http://www.grandcountyutah.net/trailmix/Maps/Gemini.pdf There is no fee to ride on the Mag 7 trails, however the BLM, Grand County Trail Mix and all the local riders would appreciate if you keep these trails nice by staying on them, cleaning up after yourself and others and not riding them if it is too muddy.

Once out of your car, make the short walk out to the canyon’s rim. Feel that little tingle in the back of your head? That tingle grows as the level ground of pavement and parking lot gives way to a sharp drop. It is 2,000 feet down to the Colorado River. Welcome to Utahs Canyon Country. This is an ideal stop for visitors to Utahs Mighty 5® and Road to Mighty® between Canyonlands and Arches national parks. The park has built a splendid network of rolling singletrack trails over gentle slickrock domes and through the knee-high sage. Though technically mild by Moab standards, the trails are a hit for riders of all abilities. Families looking for a nice cruise together will enjoy the trails. There’s also plenty of fun for more experienced riders. There are three official geocaches at Dead Horse Point. All caches are located either along trails or in day use areas. Rock scrambling is never required, and hiking off trail is prohibited. Kayenta Campground offers 17 reservable sites and 4 nonreservable sites and there are three yurts.

      "The Jewell Tibbets Arch Trail offers spectacular views across Hell Roaring Canyon to a large natural arch.  Close to several BLM campgrounds, and to Canyonlands National Park and Dead Horse Point State Park. From the parking lot, the trail passes through a fence and follows a dirt road for about 0.1 miles.  The trail leaves the road and goes down several dry washes until it rejoins an old road (closed to vehicles).  After a short distance, the trail leaves the old road, and follows a series of rock cairns to near the edge of the 400 foot deep Hell Roaring Canyon.   After a short distance, the trail follows a short spur onto a slickrock platform, from which spectacular views of the arch and the canyon below can be had.  The trail returns to the parking lot across a blackbrush mesa, where it rejoins the road.  The arch is named after Jewel Tibbetts, a Moab resident who lived about  10 miles distance at the Horsethief Ranch in the 1950’ and 1960”s with her husband Bill.  They often took ranch visitors to see the arch.There is no fee for hiking the Jewell Tibbets Arch Trail, however please leave the place nicer than when you arrived by picking up any little you may find and by staying precisely on the trail provided.  This trail sees a lot of use and needs some help from you to stay nice!  Thank you!  Note:  Hikers should exercise caution on those sections of the trail which are close to the edge of Hell-Roaring Canyon.  The trail can be very warm in summer.  Neither mountain bikes nor motorized vehicles are allowed on this trail, except for the first 0.1 miles where the trail follows an existing road.",

      "The Moab Rim Trail is a very tough and popular Jeep trail that is also adored by hikers.  The trail follows the Jeep trail up to a panoramic view of the Moab Valley, Arches National Park and the usually snowcapped LaSal Mountains.  It can be turned into a loop with the nearby Hidden Valley Trail. From the parking area, follow the 4-wheel-drive vehicle route up the slickrock ramps of Kayenta sandstone. After about 1.4 miles, the route reaches a viewpoint of the Moab Valley. Follow the vehicle route south and then down through a slickrock area located between two large domes of Navajo sandstone. At the base of the slickrock area, the route continues along a wash bottom and then up a large sand hill. From the top of the sand hill, the route branches twice to the left. The first spur on the left leads to a view point high above Spanish Valley. The second spur route ends after 200 yards at another view point. Ahead to the south, the view is dominated by a long ridge of massive sandstone fins. From the intersection, the main route drops down into a wash and then climbs in an easterly direction to its terminus just below the pass to Hidden Valley.

      "Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1980 to protect critical breeding and nesting habitat for the endangered American crocodile and other wildlife.  The refuge is located in north Key Largo and is currently comprised of 6,700 acres including 650 acres of open water.  It contains a mosaic of habitat types including tropical hardwood hammock, mangrove forest, and salt marsh.  These habitats are critical for hundreds of plants and animals including six federally-listed species.Crocodile Lake NWR is unusual in that not all of the critical habitat areas are in a pristine, undisturbed condition.  A large portion of the refuge was going to be a residential development complete with canals for boating access.  The dredge-spoil from the canal system was piled up in berms on the banks of the canals and became an important nesting area for the federally-listed American crocodile.  American crocodiles are fairly wide-spread throughout the tropics, however, in the U.S. crocodiles are only found in south Florida and the Keys. The refuge protects one of the largest remaining tracts of tropical hardwood hammock which is a globally threatened habitat type.  These diverse forests are home to hundreds of plants and animals including the federally-listed Key Largo woodrat, Key Largo cotton mouse, Schaus swallowtail butterfly, Stock Island tree snail, and Eastern indigo snake.  These species require hammocks in order to survive.  Unfortunately, most of the hammocks in Key Largo have been eliminated by development which has lead to considerable population declines in these already imperiled species.",

      'The Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area encompasses Gunnison Gorge Wilderness, Flat Top-Peach Valley, and Gunnison River Recreation Area. The river cuts a wide path through the breathtaking sandstone and black granite canyon. The area, known for its exceptional and challenging whitewater boating, also features world class gold medal trout waters. The upland desert landscape of the Flat Top-Peach Valley area provide outstanding off-highway vehicle riding for enthusiasts. Visitors to Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area can also check out cultural resources, including prehistoric rock art and historic mines.  The Gunnison Gorge Wilderness offers a wild and pristine backcountry experience, with its unique black granite and colorful sandstone double-canyon system carved by the Gunnison River. Fourteen miles of the Gunnison River flow through this wilderness area, offering diverse and abundant recreation opportunities. The Gunnison Gorge Wilderness now contains a total of 17,700 acres and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. All of the Wilderness is in the state of Colorado. In 1999 the Gunnison Gorge Wilderness became part of the now over 109 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. In wilderness, you can enjoy challenging recreational activities and extraordinary opportunities for solitude. In an age of  "...increasing population, accompanied by expanding settlement and growing mechanization,..."  you play an important role in helping to  "...secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness"  as called for by Congress in the Wilderness Act of 1964. Please follow the regulations in place for this area, and use Leave No Trace techniques when visiting to ensure protection of its unique natural and experiential qualities. For more information, contact the Gunnison Gorge NCA or Uncompahgre Field Office. How to follow the seven standard Leave No Trace principles differs in different parts of the country (desert vs. Rocky Mountains). Click on any of the principles listed below to learn more about how they apply. Leave No Trace principles:Plan Ahead and PrepareTravel and Camp on Durable SurfacesDispose of Waste ProperlyLeave What You FindMinimize Campfire ImpactsRespect WildlifeBe Considerate of Other Visitors Regulations:Motorized equipment and equipment used for mechanical transport are generally prohibited on all federal lands designated as wilderness. This includes the use of motor vehicles (including OHVs), motorboats, motorized equipment, bicycles, hang gliders, wagons, carts, portage wheels, and the landing of aircraft including helicopters, unless provided for in specific legislation. In a few areas some exceptions allowing the use of motorized equipment or mechanical transport are described in the special regulations in effect for a specific area.

      "Needle Rock is an intrusive of rhyodacite volcanic plug located in the Needle Rock Natural Area, 3.5 miles east-northeast of the Town of Crawford in Delta County, Colorado, United States. It stands 800 feet tall above the floor of the Smith Fork of the Gunnison River valley. It originated as the throat of a large volcano about 28 million years ago in the Miocene geological epoch, when molten rock intruded between existing sedimentary rocks. The plug may represent the eroded conduit of a laccolith. There are private property parcels around the base, but there is a BLM trail that more or less rings the Needle. Needle Rock lies within the western edge of the West Elk Mountains in western central Colorado. It is the remnant of a volcanic plug that pushed up through the crust, and due to the relative hardness of the basalt of which it is made, has eroded significantly slower than the surrounding mancos shale and sandstone that makes up many of the rocks in the area. Needle Rock Trail is a 0.8 mile lightly trafficked out and back trail located near Crawford, Colorado that offers scenic views and is rated as moderate. The trail offers a number of activity options and is best used from March until October. For more information, please contact the Uncompahgre Field Office.",

These animals also participate in one of the longest herd migrations of elk in the lower United States on their way to and from National Elk Refuge.  In addition to elk, the largest free roaming bison herd in the National Wildlife Refuge System, about 700 animals, winters at the Refuge.        A wide variety of habitats are found on the Refuge, including grassy meadows, marshes, timbered areas, sagebrush, and rocky outcroppings.  A variety of waterfowl, including trumpeter swans, can be seen on nearly 1,600 acres of open water and marsh lands.  At least 47 different mammals and nearly 175 different species of birds have been observed on the Refuge.  Between November and May, the wildlife concentrations and diversity are so spectacular that this Refuge has been called the "Winter Serengeti."',

The site was excavated by Brigham Young Universitys Office of Public Archaeology, in cooperation with the BLM, from 1991 to 1994. Recovered artifacts are currently stored at BYUs Museum of People and Cultures in Provo, Utah. After the excavations, the site was backfilled (reburied with the dirt that was removed during excavation), a necessary step in protecting the cultural features that remain. As a result, the foundations of the village can no longer be seen on the surface. The walls visible today are modern walls, built in 2002. Artifacts found on the ground may be observed, but not removed, from the site. Brochures and an information kiosk are located at the parking area.

Located along the south central coast of the island of Maui between the towns of Kihei and Maalaea, this 691-acre wetland is home to the endangered Hawaiian coot (aeo) and Hawaiian coot (alae ke okeo).  The refuge is adjacent to Kealia Beach, which is a nesting ground for the endangered hawksbill turtle.Kealia Pond serves as a settling basin a 56-square mile watershed that results in seasonal intermittent flooding during winter months and dryer conditions during late summer months. This creates open water (200 acres) and shallow mud flat areas interspersed with vegetation, which provide suitable resting, feeding, and nesting habitat for endangered water birds. During certain times of the year, the refuge supports at least half of the Hawaiian stilt population. The pond also supports a diverse assemblage of migratory birds from late summer (August) to early spring (April). It is one of the most important areas in the state for wintering migratory waterfowl. Migratory shorebirds also congregate here to take advantage of the food resources along the waters edge. As water recedes, fish are crowded into the remaining water, making them easy prey for aukuu (black-crowned night herons). Approximately 2,700 people visit the refuge each year to engage in various wildlife-oriented activities, including bird watching, photography, environmental education, habitat restoration projects that involve removal of exotic species, and outplanting with Hawaiis native vegetation.",

The open fields were actually created by Native Americans, who burned sections of woodland, forming grasslands to attract grazing buffalo. There are many historical features and sites to visit and explore. In the 1960s the dam was built for area flood control covering 20,150 acres at maximum flood control pool.

The lake also provides habitat for migrant passerine species that travel along the Cheyenne River on their twice-yearly flights to and from the north and the west.  The best birding area is along the undeveloped western side.The area is open year-round and an entrance fee is required year-round.

      "The United States Congress designated the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness in 2009 and it now has a total of 11,667 acres. All of this wilderness is located in Utah and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness is bordered by the Cottonwood Forest Wilderness to the north.The approximately 11,700 acre Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness is within the newly-designated Red Cliffs National Conservation Area and shares a common boundary with the Cottonwood Forest Wilderness, located on the Dixie National Forest. Here, massive blocks of Jurassic age Navajo Sandstone have been eroded by wind and water, leaving rounded domes and numerous small canyons. The resulting landscape is both austere and intimate, affording outstanding opportunities for solitude and natural quiet, just minutes away from the major population centers of Washington County. Convenient trail access makes this wilderness a popular choice for hikers and equestrians. Visit the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area web page for more information about trails in the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness.  Although it is at the western edge of the Colorado Plateau, the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness supports plant and animals species that typify the arid Mojave Desert. Pockets of desert shrubs cover the sand dunes and rocky outcrops of this wilderness. Mojave Desert species, such as Utah agave, banana yucca, scrub oak , and single-leaf ash, are found in the lowlands and line the dry washes. At higher elevations, pinyon pine and Utah juniper dot the rocky slopes of the wilderness area. Mule deer, mountain lion, bobcat, and kit fox live here, as they do farther east on the Colorado Plateau. Mojave Desert species, including the federally-listed threatened Mojave Desert tortoise and the Gila monster and chuckwalla reptiles are also residents of the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness. Golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, and the western screen owl circle the craggy canyons of this wilderness area, searching for prey. On the right day, at the right time, lucky visitors may see bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and Coopers, and sharp-shinned hawks in the area.",

Seeps in the canyon walls provide water for hanging gardens of maidenhair fern, monkeyflower, and columbine. Hawks, falcons, and golden eagles nest along the sandstone walls, while ringtailed cats, deer, cougar, and black bear live on the plateaus and in the canyon bottoms. This wilderness provides opportunities for primitive recreational activities, including hiking, equestrian trail riding, canyoneering, and camping. Several routes exist on the southern end of the wilderness providing access to higher elevations by way of steep canyons.  The Sawmill trail, however, follows an historic logging route and traverses a large portion of the wilderness. Only one route is on the northern side and provides access to Eagle Crags at about 5,200 feet. All of these routes are primitive, not maintained on a regular basis, and not signed.",

      "Deep Creek Wilderness and Deep Creek North Wilderness These two contiguous units, containing approximately 7,500 acres of public land, are located near the northeast corner of Zion National Park. In fact, Deep Creek Wilderness shares its 3 mile southern border with the Park. The elevation ranges from a low of 6,000 feet in Deep Creek Wilderness to a high of 6,800 feet in Deep Creek North Wilderness, creating an environment for dense stands of trees and shrubs. The perennial stream of Deep Creek flows for approximately 4.8 miles through the Deep Creek Wilderness and was designated as a “wild” river segment for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System through the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009.  Approximately 1.2 miles of two tributaries to the North Fork of the Virgin River also flow through the Deep Creek Wilderness and have been designated as “wild” rivers.  Deep Creek North Wilderness contains numerous drainages: Crystal Creek, Big Oak Wash, Deep Creek, and several unnamed drainages. The area just outside the Deep Creek North Wilderness is dotted with springs. This extensive cover, availability of water, and a contiguous landscape of wildlands, creates habitat for a wide variety of animals.  Mule deer, elk, mountain lion, and bobcat are the larger animals that make a home here.  Just a few of the smaller mammals include badgers, marmots, and ringtail.  Numerous birds species can be observed in the wilderness with some of the more interesting being golden eagle, screech owl, chukar partridge, and wild turkey.  The remote canyons of the wilderness provide suitable nesting habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, a threatened species.",

      "The Red Cliffs Archaeological Site houses the remains of structures from when the Ancestral Puebloans were residing there intermittently from about 500 A.D. to 1200 A.D.  The occupation spanned three distinct periods in Ancestral Puebloan history: Basketmaker III, Pueblo I, and Pueblo II.  It is common to find habitation from these periods along water sources, in this case Quail Creek, where farming of maize and other crops was possible. One or two families lived together in pithouses, and later in multi-roomed surface pueblos. The families at this site were primarily sedentary farmers, cultivating small fields along the creek, but would also gather native plants and hunt. After 1200 A.D. the Ancestral Puebloans abandoned this site, possibly due to prolonged drought periods and climate change.BLM archaeologists excavated this site between 1977 and 1979, assisted by Youth Adult Conservation Corps youth crews. Data from the Red Cliffs site provided knowledge about the Ancestral Puebloan culture and way of life in southwestern Utah, which scientists only had very little familiarity with at the time. Many artifacts were recovered, including stone tools and pottery, which are now curated at the museum at Southern Utah University.",

      "Recommended Users: Mountain Bikers, Hikers. Singletrack trail. 2.53 miles in length. Difficulty: Extremely difficult. From the trailhead, the trail immediately drops down a steep, rugged slope and careens toward the cliff edge on your right.  Follow the narrow, winding track southeast as it traverses the crumbling layers of sandstone, siltstone and mudstone below the mesa rim. Expect a steep, rocky descent along the entire trail, with sharp turns, sudden drop-offs and precipitous exposure. Keep in mind that entire sections of the trail may be washed out in places due to its location on a steep, eroded slope. The trail becomes braided in several sections, allowing users to choose one of several interconnected paths on their descent.If you have time to look up, you’ll be rewarded with dramatic vistas of colorful badlands in the foreground, Gooseberry Mesa to the south, the craggy peaks of Canaan Mountain Wilderness to the southeast and the majestic West Temple of Zion National Park to the east.While keeping your eyes on the trail, you will experience a speedy ride-through tour of local geology. The trail begins in the Chinle Formation of the Upper Triassic Age atop the mesa then descends quickly through the Moenkopi layer of the Lower Triassic, a blur of red sandstone under your tires.  Soon after, you are plummeting through talus from the Holocene to upper Pleistocene Age before revisiting the Moenkopi Formation near the bottom of the escarpment.Once the trail drops to rolling lowlands and levels out, find your way back to SR 9 near Virgin by following the well-traveled dirt road south.   Note: This trail should only be considered by expert mountain bicyclists. Throughout its length, it features narrow tread width, widely variable and unpredictable tread surfaces, 20% or more average trail grade, jumps, unavoidable obstacles, loose rocks and extreme exposure. There are no convenient places to stop or turn around and the cost of a mistake in many places could result in serious injury or death.

      "Spring Creek Canyon Wilderness Study Area (WSA) is located in the southeastern corner of Iron County, Utah about 7 miles southwest of Cedar City. The WSA is 4,433 acres and measures approximately 6 miles from north to south and 3 miles from east to west. Private and state land surrounds most of the WSA with the state land nearly bisecting the study area. The southern boundary adjoins Zion National Park. All land within the WSA is managed by the BLM Cedar City Field Office. Spring Creek Canyon WSA includes a portion of the Hurricane Cliffs, an awesome west facing escarpment that extends from north of Cedar City into northwestern Arizona. Two major canyons, Kanarra Falls and Spring Creek Canyon, bisect the WSA with elevations ranging from 5,600 feet at the base of the cliffs to almost 7,900 feet on the ridge tops. Vegetation consists primarily of juniper, scrub oak, shrubs, and grasses; however, along the riparian zone, sedges, rushes, cottonwoods, and willows are prevalent. The area provides habitat for various birds of prey such as the bald eagle and peregrine falcon as well as 13 species of animals and 4 plant species that are considered sensitive.  The majority of the WSA is rated outstanding for scenic quality due to the stunning, narrow red rock canyons that offer spectacular hiking along the streambeds. In particular, hiking in Kanarra Canyon involves traveling (and sometimes wading) along Kanarra Creek and climbing up and over several beautiful waterfalls. Due to its immense beauty and unique hiking opportunities, this area sees a large number of visitors every year.",

      "While Birch Hollow offers spectacular views, it requires a technical rope descent down rappels as long as 120 feet. The canyon exits in Orderville Gulch. From there, you can continue upstream to exit at the Orderville Gulch Trailhead, or continue downstream and exit in Zion National Park. If you chose to exit the Gulch downstream, a permit from Zion National Park is required prior to your trip.    A second vehicle is needed to shuttle hikers from the Orderville Gulch Trailhead, or Zion National Park, back to their vehicle at the Birch Hollow Trailhead.   For more information, detailed maps, and current conditions, contact the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument Visitor Center in Kanab, UT.  Type of Trip: This is typically done as a day trip. If exiting the canyon at the upstream Orderville Gulch Trailhead, it usually takes approximately 4 to 6 hours. If you exit downstream in Zion National Park, it will take approximately 8 to 12 hours. A permit is required from Zion National Park to exit downstream from Birch Hollow.   Mileage: 5 Ѕ miles to the Orderville Gulch Trailhead  8 Ѕ miles to the top of route 92  11 miles to Temple of Sinawava  Amenities: The Birch Hollow trailhead offers an informational kiosk.

      "Orson B. Adams House    The St. George Field Office has completed rehabilitation of a mid-19th century Mormon pioneer residence for adaptive re-use.  This small sandstone masonry house was built in 1863 for the Orson B. Adams family, in the now abandoned Mormon agricultural settlement of Harrisburg, located approximately 15 miles north of St. George.   Critical to the successful completion of the rehabilitation project were partnerships with Washington County, the Utah Heritage Foundation, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation; technical assistance from the Utah State Historic Preservation Office; and volunteer labor during several phases of the project.  The Adams house is open sporadically for public visitation with the assistance of volunteer docents.      In 2004, Washington County, Utah State University (USU), and the Utah Chapter-American Society of Landscape Architects worked with BLM to create a conceptual plan for public recreation use of the 215 acres that surround the Adams house.  Quail Creek flows through the tract, creating a lush riparian area with tall cottonwood trees and willows. Other historic Harrisburg structures, terraced gardens, an orchard, fields outlined by native rock walls, irrigation ditches, and wagon roads are preserved on the property.  Students and faculty from USU documented the features of this still-intact 19th century agrarian landscape, as part of the first Historic American Landscape Survey conducted in Utah.  The final concept plan will integrate the Adams house with a system of linked hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails that connect to trails in the Red Cliffs Recreation Area, the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, and the nearby historic Silver Reef mining district.    Based on the conceptual plan, BLM completed an environmental assessment for the proposed development of a non-motorized trail system and an equestrian trailhead. Today the White Reef Trailhead provides access to a trail system that visits 5 public use sites within the Red Cliffs Recreation Area including the Orson B. Adams House.",

      "Wagon travel on the Northern Route of the Old Spanish Trail began in 1847, when the first Mormon settlement in Utah Territory was established east of the Great Salt Lake.   Exploration parties were immediately sent by church leaders to identify locations suitable for colonization along the Old Spanish Trail, to gain political control of the most important travel corridor in the Intermountain West.   In October of 1847, Jefferson Hunt, who had served in the Mormon Battalion in California, led a group of 18 men, 130 pack mules, and a single wagon to southern California to buy cattle, seed grain, and other needed goods.   The party arrived in San Bernardino after 45 days of travel, having reportedly brought the first wagon over the Old Spanish Trail.  The success of this expedition encouraged others to follow, including large numbers of prospectors and merchants “rushing” to the newly-discovered gold deposits at Sutter’s Mill in northern California during the winter months when the passes of the high Sierras would be impassable.  Over time, the wagon road that developed was labeled on maps as the “Old Southern Road”, the “Immigrant Road” or the “Old Mormon Road”.    By the first decade of the 20th century, early automobiles were traveling this same route and paved highways eventually replaced the wagon ruts.",

Singletrack. 1 mile in length Difficulty: Extremely Difficult.The Old Wood Road earned its namesake after it was built by pioneers to access Grafton Mesa from the town below. You can still see remnants of the initial construction holding the trail in place. The trail, and surrounding area are HIGHLY sensitive cultural resources and should be treated with respect. Any harm to cultural resources could result in trail closure.The trail begins on the edge of Grafton Mesa, with a beautiful vista of the gates of Zion National Park. Expect a steep, rocky descent along the entire trail, with sharp turns, sudden drop-offs and precipitous exposure. Keep in mind that entire sections of the trail may be washed out in places due to its location on a steep, eroded slope. The trail becomes braided in several sections, allowing users to choose one of several interconnected paths on their descent. Only expert riders, comfortable with exposure should attempt the Grafton descent.Note: This trail should only be considered by expert mountain bicyclists. Throughout its length, it features narrow tread width, widely variable and unpredictable tread surfaces, 20% or more average trail grade, jumps, unavoidable obstacles, loose rocks and extreme exposure. There are no convenient places to stop or turn around and the cost of a mistake in many places could result in serious injury or death.

      'Deep Creek Wilderness and Deep Creek North Wilderness These two contiguous units, containing approximately 7,500 acres of public land, are located near the northeast corner of Zion National Park. In fact, Deep Creek Wilderness shares its 3 mile southern border with the Park. The elevation ranges from a low of 6,000 feet in Deep Creek Wilderness to a high of 6,800 feet in Deep Creek North Wilderness, creating an environment for dense stands of trees and shrubs. The perennial stream of Deep Creek flows for approximately 4.8 miles through the Deep Creek Wilderness and was designated as a "wild" river segment for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System through the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009.  Approximately 1.2 miles of two tributaries to the North Fork of the Virgin River also flow through the Deep Creek Wilderness and have been designated as "wild" rivers.  Deep Creek North Wilderness contains numerous drainages: Crystal Creek, Big Oak Wash, Deep Creek, and several unnamed drainages. The area just outside the Deep Creek North Wilderness is dotted with springs. This extensive cover, availability of water, and a contiguous landscape of wildlands, creates habitat for a wide variety of animals.  Mule deer, elk, mountain lion, and bobcat are the larger animals that make a home here.  Just a few of the smaller mammals include badgers, marmots, and ringtail.  Numerous birds species can be observed in the wilderness with some of the more interesting being golden eagle, screech owl, chukar partridge, and wild turkey.  The remote canyons of the wilderness provide suitable nesting habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, a threatened species.',

      "The Honeymoon Trail During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a primitive wagon road was the principle travel route between the Mormon settlements in northeastern Arizona and southern Utah.   In the late 1870s, Mormon colonists had been sent by church leaders to pioneer new settlements along Arizona’s Little Colorado River.  As the new settlements were remote and isolated, many goods and services could only be obtained from the established Mormon communities of southern Utah.   After 1877, the Arizona Mormon settlers also traveled to St. George, Utah to conduct church business and have their marriage vows solemnized in the newly-completed St. George Temple.  So many newlyweds traveled the wagon road that it came to be known as “the Honeymoon Trail”.Couples would travel in small groups for safety and companionship to make this long-distance trek across the varied and rugged terrain of northeastern Arizona and southwestern Utah.   This journey typically began in mid-November and required many weeks of hard travel to complete.   The wagons jolted across deep dry washes and slick rock, bogged down in deep sandy soils, and became mired in muddy stream crossings.   At Lee’s Ferry, John D. Lee and his wife Emma provided regular ferry service for travelers, at one of the few feasible crossings of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.   Their journey then took them to Kanab, Utah, south to Pipe Springs, Arizona, finally heading north into Washington County.  Here, the Honeymoon Trail followed Fort Pearce Wash and headed north through the Warner Valley into St. George.  The spring at the historic Fort Pearce site was a popular overnight camping spot for these travelers, some of whom inscribed their names and the dates of their visits on the rocky cliff faces at the spring.   After their marriage ceremonies, the newlyweds would often spend the winter months in St. George, enjoying the social activities of this established community and purchasing needed supplies.  They began the long trip home in the early spring.  The Honeymoon Trail continued in use well into the 20th century, when modern highways were finally constructed across northeastern Arizona.",

The Refuge was established in 1964 on lands aquired by the Corp of Engineers in conjunction with the Coffeeville Lock and Dam project. The 4,218 acre refuge encompasses approximately 1,802 acres of lakes, sloughs, and creeks, 2,265 acres of bottomland hardwoods, and 151 acres of croplands and moist soil units.The refuge is divided into three units by Okatuppa and Turkey Creeks. This makes a large portion of the refuge accessable only by boat. Due to its location along the Tombigbee River, the entire refuge is subject to annual Spring flooding. The primary purpose of the refuge is to provide wood duck brood habitat and serve as a protected wintering area for waterfowl. Up to 200 broods of wood ducks are produced anually in the refuges artificial nest boxes, and wintering waterfowl numbers can exceed 10,000. In addition, numerous neotropical migrant and wading birds benefit from management activities.  Following a successful bald eagle hacking program in the early 1990s the refuge has played host to a nesting pair of eagles each winter. During the summer months wood storks can be found resting and feeding in the back-water sloughs and moist soil units. Resident wildlife includes white-tailed deer, gray squirrels, turkey, raccoons, opossum, American alligator, and beaver.",

Established September 25, 2002 for the purpose of protecting and managing a unique section of the Cahaba River and land adjacent to it.  Cahaba River NWR is home to five federally listed species including the Cahaba shiner, goldline darter, round rocksnail, and cylindrical lioplax snail.  Currently, the Refuge is 2,997 acres but planned acquisition efforts will bring the refuge up to 3,800 acres. The Cahaba River itself stretches for almost 200 miles and is Alabamas longest free-flowing stream.  The river currently supports 64 rare and imperiled plant and animal species, 13 of which are found nowhere else in the world.  The river has more fish species at 131 than any other river its size in North America.  Three and one-half miles of the Cahaba lie within the approved acquisition boundary.  The rolling uplands surrounding the river are forested with mountain longleaf and loblolly pines.  Mixed upland hardwood species line ravines and the rivers edge. The largest known stand of the imperiled shoals lily (known locally as the Cahaba lily) also occurs within the Refuge.  During summer months, this beautiful plant blooms and people come from across the region to view this magnificent display of nature.  There is even an annual Cahaba lily festival that draws thousands of visitors to the area the last Saturday in May.",

Collier Cave, located approximately 1.5 miles upstream from Key Cave and within the acquisition boundary, is important to both species as potential habitat.  Both caves are on the northern shore of Pickwick Lake in a limestone karst area that contains numerous sinkholes and several underground cave systems.  The areas sinkholes are an integral component of groundwater recharge to the caves.  The area directly north of Key Cave was identified as a potential high hazard risk area for groundwater recharge and this is where the 1,060-acre Refuge was established.",

      'Claiborne Lake is the most primitive of the Alabama River Lakes. Nestled in Alabamas southwest hill country, the lake encompasses over 60 miles of the Alabama River, stretching from the Claiborne Lock and Dam to Millers Ferry Lock and Dam.  Claiborne Lock and Dam was completed in 1971 but was opened for navigation in November 1969. It has no power installation.  Although the lake remains mostly within the original river banks, Claiborne provides extensive opportunities for water-related recreation.  Bisecting Alabamas Black Prairie Belt, the William "Bill" Dannelly Reservoir encompasses 105 miles of the Alabama River.  Dannelly Reservoir boasts an area of about 27 square miles and a shoreline of more than 500 miles. Since opening in 1974, the lake and its surrounding parks have become a recreational center, offering excellent fishing, skiing, boating and hunting.  With its great appeal to sportsmen, birders, naturalists and those who just want to "get away from it all," its little wonder that almost 3 million people visit Dannelly each year.  Woodruff Lake offers such activities as fishing, boating, water-skiing, picnicking, camping, swimming and hiking. The project features 11 parks that are well-facilitated for visitors. Conveniences at the parks include beaches, campgrounds, picnic areas, trails and boat launching ramps. Since construction of the first park in 1975, annual attendance figures have soared to over 2 million.',

The refuge is considered to have one of the best existing wetland habitat areas along the Atlantic Coast.  The intensively managed freshwater impoundments have become important stop-over sites for spring and fall migrating shorebirds and wading birds.  Endangered and threatened species management activities provide habitat for the Delmarva fox squirrel, nesting bald eagles and migrating peregrine falcons.  Neotropical land birds passing through the area utilize the refuges upland forested habitat during the fall and spring.  The refuges 10,000 acres are a diverse landscape featuring freshwater and salt marshes, woodlands, grasslands, scrub-brush habitats, ponds, bottomland forested areas, a 7 mile long creek, and agricultural lands.

Because of this great variety in habitat, many different species of birds are attracted to the refuge throughout the year.  In the summer, thousands of egrets and herons nest in the swamps, while in the winter, large concentrations of ducks (especially mallards, gadwall and teal) gather in the marshland and freshwater pools. Over 15 miles of paved roads and trails provide the visitor easy access to the many different habitats.

      'Okefenokee NWR, located about 11 miles southwest of Folkston, was established in 1937 to preserve the 438,000 acre Okefenokee Swamp. The refuge encompasses approximately 396,000 acres with 353,000 acres designated as a National Wilderness Area. Swamp habitats include open wet "prairies," cypress forests, scrub-shrub vegetation, upland islands, and open lakes. Wildlife species include wading birds, ducks, alligators and other reptiles, a variety of amphibians, bobcats, raptors, white-tailed deer, black bears, and songbirds. The swamp has a rich human history including Native American occupation, early settlers, a massive drainage attempt, and intensive timber harvesting. Glimpses of the past are visible at Chesser Island Homestead, Billys Island, Floyds Island, and Suwannee Canal. The prosperity and survival of the swamp, and the species dependent on it, is directly tied with maintaining the integrity of complex ecological processes, including hydrology and fire.',

Few traces of the islands plantation in the 1800s exist today.  From 1937 to 1975, when it was donated to the Fish and Wildlife Service, Pinckney Island was privately owned and managed as a game preserve.          The 4,053 acre refuge includes Pinckney Island, Corn Island, Big and Little Harry Islands, Buzzard Island and numerous small hammocks.  Pinckney is the largest of the islands and the only one open to public use.  Nearly 67% of the refuge consists of salt marsh and tidal creeks.  A wide variety of land types are found on Pinckney Island alone:  salt marsh, forestland, brushland, fallow field and freshwater ponds.  In combination, these habitats support a diversity of bird and plant life.  Wildlife commonly observed on Pinckney Island include waterfowl, shorebirds, wading birds, raptors, neo-tropical migrants, white-tailed deer and American alligators, with large concentrations of white ibis, herons, and egrets.",

      'Modern day Grays Reef comprises one of the largest nearshore sandstone reefs in the southeastern United States. Named in recognition of Milton B. Gray, a biological collector and curator at the University of Georgia Marine Institute, who studied the area during the 1960s, its located 32 kilometers (17.5 nautical miles) off Sapelo Island, Georgia. Sanctuary boundaries protect 17 square miles of open ocean. Sandstone outcroppings and ledges up to ten feet in height separate the sandy, flat-bottomed troughs in a reef that combines temperate and tropical qualities. The rocky platform, some 60 to 70 feet below the Atlantic Oceans surface, is wreathed in a carpet of attached organisms and is known locally as a "live bottom habitat." This flourishing ecosystem provides not only vertical relief, but also a solid base for the abundant invertebrates to attach to and grow upon. Grouper, black sea bass, mackerel, and angelfish and a host of other fish are attracted by the reef. Following close behind the schools of fish are the many sport fishing and diving enthusiasts who have made Grays Reef one of the most popular recreation areas along the Georgia coast.  Many visitors to Grays Reef National Marine Sanctuary enjoy the diving opportunities there.',

Smack dab in the middle of the Mississippi Flyway, 43,500-acre Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge provides a winter feeding and resting area for an average of 40,000 Canada geese each year. Agriculture and logging in the early 1900s so depleted this region of forest, wetland, and grassland that wildlife could barely subsist here. The refuge was formed in 1947 to restore an adequate ground for geese, ducks, wild turkeys, a multitude of white-tailed deer, and small mammals including coyotes, beavers, opossums, and raccoons. Five thousand acres of the refuge are planted each year to feed wildfowl. Most people visit the refuge to bird-watch, hunt, and fish. Anglers cast a line for bass, bluegill, and crappie on Crab Orchard Lake, Devils Kitchen Lake, Little Grassy Lake, and many smaller lakes. The Wilderness forms the southern tip of the refuge and encompasses sections of Little Grassy Lake and Devils Kitchen Lake. Several parking lots and boat launches provide easy access to the water. Within Crab Orchard Wilderness boundaries lie dramatic sandstone outcroppings, wood-lined creeks, and potential seclusion, but there are no maintained trails. Camping is restricted to designated campsites, of which there are none in the Wilderness area (except for preexisting camps for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts).",

Many buildings now housing industries were used in the manufacturing of explosives during World War II, and they are still used for military ordnance production today. The concrete igloos built for munition storage are now leased to private industry for storage of many types of products.",

      'Cypress Creek National Wildlife Refuge is located in southernmost Illinois, within the Cache River Watershed. The refuge was established in 1990 under the Emergency Wetlands Resource Act of 1986 to protect, restore, and manage wetlands and bottomland forests that provide habitat for waterfowl and other migratory birds, resident wildlife, and endangered and threatened species. Currently, the refuge protects 15,000 acres, with the vision of a 35,000-acre contiguous tract of land connected by remnants of cypress-tupelo swamps, oak barrens, and vast stands of bottomland forests. The refuge and surrounding Cache River Wetlands are considered Illinois Bayou - a large swamp/wetland complex in the Midwest which harbors a rich collection of biologically significant natural communities. The Cache River and Cypress Creek Wetland was designated a "Wetland of International Importance" (Ramsar site) for its rich diversity of plant and animal communities; it claims some of the oldest living trees east of the Mississippi River and harbors 91% of Illinois high-quality swamp habitat. The refuge is a member of a unique partnership to restore and manage the Cache River Wetlands. Together, the refuge, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), The Nature Conservancy,  and Ducks Unlimited share a common goal to protect and restore 60,000 acres along a 50-mile corridor of the Cache River. Wildlife observation, hiking, canoe trails, and hunting and fishing are just a few of the activities offered at this new refuge.',

The refuge is being assembled to protect, restore, and manage migratory bird, fish, and resident wildlife habitat in the Illinois River Valley, while providing for increased public recreation and educational opportunities. When complete, it will contain 11,122 acres. Historically, two backwater lakes, Thompson (1,800 acres) and Flag (1,000 acres), provided excellent habitat for migratory birds, fish, and resident wildlife. The Fulton and Mason County areas ability to support an abundance of fish and wildlife and the popularity of traditional outdoor activities once made the area the tourism capital of Illinois. When restored, Emiquon will provide quality backwater lake, bottomland forest, upland forest, prairie, seasonal wetland, and marsh habitat for migratory birds, fish, and resident wildlife. An additional 1,100 acres will be retained for agricultural crops for wildlife. Emiquon Refuge is part of the Illinois River National Wildlife Refuge Complex, with headquarters at Chautauqua Refuge, in Havana, Illinois.",

      'The Middle Mississippi River National Wildlife Refuge was established on May 31, 2000.  It has three divisions - Meissner Island, near Valmeyer, Illinois; Harlow Island, near Festus, Missouri; and Wilkinson Island, near Gorham, Illinois. The refuge headquarters is co-located with Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge. Middle Miss Refuge is part of the Mark Twain National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The complex was established in 1958 for the protection of migratory birds and spans 350 miles along the Mississippi River in the states of Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri.  It includes Port Louisa, Two Rivers, Great River, Clarence Cannon, and Middle Mississippi River refuges. Middle Miss Refuge lands were purchased in response to the great flood of 1993 and are unique in the refuge complex. The refuge tracts lie within the uncontrolled portion of the Middle Mississippi River, below the confluence with the Missouri, where river levels are not regulated by the lock and dam system.  Water levels may fluctuate greatly in this "open river" section of the Mississippi, and frequent flooding occurs on these lands. Much of the refuge land had previously been cut off from the floodplain by private levees that protected acgricultural lands.  Most of the levees were breached by the 1993 flood and will not be repaired.  These lands will provide access to the floodplain for native fish during high water stages and create a corridor of floodplain forest habitat for migratory birds and resident wildlife.',

All refuge divisions are within the famous Mississippi Flyway, one of the nations most important migration routes. In fact, the primary refuge management objective is to provide waterfowl and migratory birds with food, water, and protection during the spring and fall migration. Each refuge division has unique characteristics. The Louisa Division is the most intensively managed via water-level manipulation, controlled burning, grassland management, and tree planting activities. Big Timber is a forested backwater slough open to the Mississippi River. Keithsburg is a forested backwater slough leveed off from the Mississippi. The newest division, Horseshoe Bend, is being restored to native vegetation, including bottomland hardwoods, wetlands, and native prairie. It is open to floodwaters of the Iowa River. The Iowa River Corridor is managed by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources in cooperation with the National Wildlife Refuge System.  The corridor is approximately 10,000 acres of restored floodplain on the Iowa River between Tama and the Amana colonies.

      'Quivira National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was established in 1955 to provide wintering and migration stopover habitat for migratory birds along the Central Flyway of North America. The name "Quivira" comes from a Native American tribe that lived in the area when the explorer, Coronado, visited in 1541. It is believed to mean "raccoon eyes" in reference to tattoos that resembled a raccoons mask around the eyes of the areas Native Americans. For years, the marshes of Quivira NWR have attracted thousands of migrating waterfowl. These marshes, together with a wide diversity of other habitats, provide food, cover, and protection for wildlife. Wetlands, large and small, are present throughout the Refuge; there are approximately 7,000 acres of wetlands with slightly to moderately saline water. Thousands of Canada geese, ducks, and other migratory birds, such as sandhill cranes and shorebirds, use these wetlands as they pass through the Refuge on their annual migrations.',

Facilities available at these areas include designated campsites both with and without electricity, group picnic and camping areas, potable water, sanitary facilities, boat launching ramps, a playground, ballfield and a swimming beach with a change house. Camping fees are collected at three of the park areas and a day use fee is collected for the beach and boat ramps. More detailed information regarding the fee program can be obtained at the project office.   Other features of the lake include the Big Hill Lake Horse Trail. This trail is 17 miles long and provides a variety of terrain for all ages to enjoy. It also offers tethering areas and three parking area which are equipped with limited facilities and may be used for overnight camping by trail riders.   Due to stocking, fish shelters and leaving large areas of timber and other vegetation standing, Big Hill has developed into one of the most productive and popular fishing spots in the area. Principal species of sport fish include largemouth bass, crappie, channel and flathead catfish, bluegill, walleye and smallmouth bass.   With Big Hill being one of the clearest lakes in Kansas, our alcohol-free sand-covered beach has become a popular spot for cooling off from the summer heat.',

      'If you enjoy camping, boating, fishing, hunting, or wildlife watching - we have the place for you. Completed in 1968, Marion Reservoir encompasses 6,200 acres of water surrounded by another 6,000 acres of public lands. The lake is located just north of U.S. Highway 56 between the communities of Marion and Hillsboro, Kansas.   Camping and picnicking opportunities are numerous with 171 campsites located in four parks - Cottonwood Point, Hillsboro Cove, Marion Cove, and French Creek Cove.   Campsites contain picnic tables, grills and/or fire-rings, sun-shelters and gravel parking pads. Facilities at our class "A" parks, Cottonwood Point and Hillsboro Cove, include electrical hookups, showers, RV dump stations, group camping areas, group picnic areas, playgrounds, and beaches. Potable water is available in all parks. Cottonwood Point also includes some sites with 50 amp electrical service and individual water hookups.   A special treat for wildlife observers is the 1-mile Willow Walk Nature Trail located at Cottonwood Point.   Maps and information on specific facilities, fees, the Golden Age/Access discount and park regulations are available from gate attendants, park rangers, or the project office at (316) 382-2101.   Anglers have bright opportunities at Marion Reservoir. The lake is noted for its walleye, crappie, white bass, wipers and channel catfish. The lake also contains largemouth bass, and a good population of lunker-size flathead catfish. An 18-inch length limit is in effect for walleyes and black bass. Fish feeders are located in Hillsboro Cove and Cottonwood Point.   Boaters will find boat ramps located around the lake at Cottonwood Point (2 ramps, 4 lanes), Hillsboro Cove, Marion Cove (2 lanes), French Creek, Durham Cove and Broken Bridge. Developed ramps provide lights and courtesy docks. There is a fee to use these ramps. The undeveloped ramps at Durham Cove and Broken Bridge are free.   Hunters at Marion Reservoir will find a mixed bag including pheasants, quail, rabbits, turkeys, and white-tail deer. Waterfowl hunters will find good populations of Canada, snow, and white-front geese as well as all species of ducks found within the Central Flyway.   The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks maintains a large percentage of the perimeter of the lake as a public hunting area. A map showing the location of this public hunting land may be obtained at the project office. The Department also maintains a waterfowl refuge at Marion Reservoir located just east of French Creek Cove that is off-limits to the public. Its boundaries are designated on the Marion Reservoir brochure and the hunting map.',

      "The Breton Wilderness now contains a total of 5,000 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Services Breton National Wildlife Refuge. All of the Wilderness is in the state of Louisiana. In 1975 the Breton Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. Located off the delta of the great Mississippi River, Breton Island actually consists of two adjacent islands (north and south) with a combined length of about three miles and a width of less than one mile. Part of a long chain of barrier islands, they comprise only a small section of Breton National Wildlife Refuge. The greater portion of the refuge consists of the Chandeleur Islands, an approximately 20-mile-long crescent of land lying north of Breton. Between Breton and Chandeleur are more islands owned by the state and managed by the refuge. Geologically young, these unstable islands were created by the erosion and reshaping of a former Mississippi River delta. On the Gulf of Mexico side of the islands youll find low sandy beaches tapering into a maze of ponds, inlets, and saltwater marshes. Hundreds of thousands of seabirds use these islands as nesting and wintering habitat. Endangered brown pelicans have made a dramatic return under careful refuge management. Camping is not allowed. Human visitors are common, sometimes coming for bird watching but primarily for surf fishing. Almost all of the refuge is designated Wilderness.",

All of the Wilderness is in the state of Louisiana. In 1976 the Lacassine Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. On the southern end of the Mississippi and Central Flyways, Lacassine National Wildlife Refuge is primarily a freshwater marsh. Lacassine refuge marshes provide feeding and resting habitat for more than 300,000 ducks and 80,000 geese. The refuge also provides habitat for many shorebirds, wading birds, marsh birds, various manmmals,and alligators. The first nesting colony of cattle egrets outside Florida was discovered here. Nesting rookeries of roseate spoonbills, and other wading birds can be found in the Lacassine Pool. Watch for armadillos, swamp rabbits, minks, otters, nutrias and American alligators. The southern portion of the refuge, south of the pipeline canal and west of Bayou Misere, has been designated Wilderness. Unlike the rest of the refuge, this area has seen relatively little impact from human activity. There are no established trails, and no camping is allowed. The 3345 acre wilderness area can be accessed by non-motorized vessel or chest waders. The name Lacassine comes from the local native American word "loc oshin", which means "at the prairies edge".',

The refuge is located within the city limits of New Orleans and encompasses approximately 23, 000 acres.  It is the largest urban National Wildlife refuge in the United States.  The refuge is one of the last remaining marsh areas adjacent to Lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne. The refuge contains a wide variety of habitat including bottomland hardwoods, fresh and brackish water marshes, lagoons, canals, borrow pits, cheniers, and natural bayous.  Most of the refuge is located within massive hurricane protection levees built to protect New Orleans East from storm surges and flooding, thusly a network of pumps and flapgates provide a way of regulating water levels seasonally to encourage the summer growth of emergent plants that in turn provide waterfowl food supplies in the winter. The American Alligator is the most common predator on the refuge that also help control the number of rodents as well as the exotic nutria.  This diverse habitat supports 340 bird species and waterfowl in the number of 50,000 use the wetland areas during the fall, winter and early spring months.  The city of New Orleans was the recipient of the first US Fish and Wildlife Service Urban Treaty for Bird Conservation grant which educated youth about birds and bird habitat on the refuge. Bayou Sauvage boasts more than 150,000 visitors annually who have the opportunity to go canoeing, hiking, biking, birdwatching, fishing, crabbing, and crawfishing.",

The 2,000 acre scenic lake is owned by the city and serves as its secondary water source.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a free ninety-nine year management lease on the lake.  The Service purchased 2,200 acres of land surrounding the lake, which expanded the refuge to 4,200 acres and protected most of the lakes watershed.  The beautiful natural lake is studded with picturesque cypress and tupelo trees, and surrounded by swamps that graduate into bottomland hardwoods and then into upland mixed pine/hardwoods.  The refuge supports an excellent fisheries resource and provides valuable habitat for migratory waterfowl, neotropical migratory songbirds, and many resident wildlife species. This semi-urban refuge is ideally located to provide a place for people to connect with the natural world.  It is one of four refuges managed in the North Louisiana Refuges Complex.  The complex visitor center, a restored planters house, is situated on the 40 acre Black Bayou Lake Environmental Education Center.  Adjacent to the visitor center are an arboretum with over 100 native Louisiana woody plants and a prairie demonstration area with native grasses and wildflowers.  Facilities also include interactive visitor center exhibits, a mile long raised asphalt/boardwalk nature trail with 400 foot wildlife pier, boat launch, amphitheater and pavilion, a raised observation deck with spotting scope and several informational kiosks.

      "The Breton National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1904 and is the second oldest refuge in the National Wildlife Refuge System.  The refuge is comprised of a series of barrier islands including Breton Island and all of the Chandeleur Islands in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. It was formed from the remnants of the Mississippi Rivers former St.Bernard Delta, which was active 2000 years ago.  The barrier islands size and shapes constantly are altered by tropical storms, wind, and tidal action.  The area above mean high tide is approximately 6,923 acres.  In 1975, the refuge was established as a National Wilderness Area.  And in 1990, an agreement with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service authorizing the service management rights and law enforcement authority on additional State of Louisiana owned lands.  The agreement increased the refuge by an additional 11,350 acres for a total of 18,273 acres. The objectives for the refuge are to provide sanctuary for nesting and wintering seabirds, protect and preserve the wilderness character of the islands, and provide sandy beach habitat for a variety of wildlife species.  Twenty-three species of seabirds and shorebirds frequently use the refuge, and thirteen species nest on the various islands.  The most abundant nesters are brown pelicans, laughing gulls, and royal, caspian, and sandwich terns.  Over ten thousand brown pelicans have been recorded nesting on the refuge.  Endangered and threatened species such as the least tern, brown pelican, and piping plover are common to the refuge.  Waterfowl winter near the refuge islands and benefit from adjacent shallows, marshes, and sounds for feeding and protection during inclement weather.  Redheads and lesser scaup account for most waterfowl numbers.",

      "Catahoula National Wildlife Refuge, located in east central Louisiana, 12 miles east of Jena, was established in 1958 as a wintering area for migratory waterfowl.  The refuge contains 25,162 acres divided into two units.  The 6,671 acre Headquarters Unit borders nine miles of the northeast shore of Catahoula Lake, a 26,000 acre natural wetland renowned for its large concentrations of migratory waterfowl.  The 18,491 acre Bushley Bayou Unit, located 8 miles west of Jonesville, was established May 16, 2001.  This acquisition was made possible through a partnership agreement between The Conservation Fund, American Electric Power, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.  The habitat found at the refuge is primarily lowland hardwood forest subject to seasonal backwater flooding from the Ouachita, Black, and Red Rivers. White-tailed deer, small game mammals, songbirds, raptors, waterbirds, reptiles, and amphibians are commonly seen throughout the refuge.  Waterfowl are abundant during the winter. Peak waterfowl populations of 75,000 ducks have been recorded. In 1979, the Duck Lake Impoundment was created to provide 1200 acres of waterfowl habitat.  Management of the impoundment is to manipulate water levels to promote the growth of aquatic and moist soil vegetation.  In 2001, Catahoula NWR was designated a Globally Important Bird Area.  Catahoula Lake is recognized as a Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR site):  a historic concentration area for shorebirds, waterbirds, and migrating/wintering waterfowl. Catahoula NWR also borders a portion of the Dewey Wills Wildlife Management Area. Together, these areas provide a haven for wildlife and preserve representative samples of the unique habitats originally found in the Lower Mississippi River Ecosystem.",

Prior to clearing, this productive bottomland hardwood ecosystem provided ideal habitat for forest wildlife, but the shift toward agriculture and shallow marsh has made it more attractive to a wide variety of waterfowl, wading birds, and shorebirds.  Due to its location in east-central Louisiana, the refuge is influenced by both the Mississippi and Central Flyways and the large expanses of shallow wetlands draw a diversity of waterfowl species. Although Northern pintails, mallards, wood ducks, and green-winged teal are the dominant species, blue-winged teal, northern shovelers, gadwall and American wigeon are also common during the fall and winter months.  Large numbers of snow and white-fronted geese winter on the refuge.  During the spring and summer months, a variety of migratory songbirds utilize the bayous, scattered forested tracts, and shallow marsh habitat.

      'Lacassine NWR, in Cameron and Evangeline Parishes in southwestern Louisiana, was established on 12/30/37 by Executive Order No. 7780 as "a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife."  The refuge is nearly 35,000 acres in size, including  653 acres leased from the Cameron Parish School Board. The vegetation types occurring on the refuge are primarily water tolerant grasses, sedges, and shrubs.  Vegetation in the undeveloped marshes is dominated by bulltongue and maidencane. The habitat is divided into 16,500 acres of natural, freshwater marsh and open water, 16,000 acres of managed, freshwater marsh (Lacassine Pool), 2,200 acres of rice, wheat, soybean, and natural moist soil fields, 350 acres of flooded gum and cypress trees, and 350 acres of restored tallgrass prairie. Wildlife species found on the refuge are those indigenous to the marshes of coastal Louisiana. Several nesting colonies of wading and water birds such as ibis, roseate spoonbills, and egrets are found here. A large population of alligators and furbearers such as nutria and raccoon are also found on the refuge. Endangered species reported on the refuge include bald  eagles, peregrine falcons, and Louisiana black bears. Several hundred thousand ducks and geese use the refuge as wintering habitat while wood ducks, fulvous and black-bellied whistling ducks, and mottled ducks nest on the refuge during the breeding season. Recreational opportunities for refuge visitors abound! The refuge offers fishing, hunting, boating, wildlife observation, and hiking. Lacassine NWR, known for attracting thousands of pintails each winter (a peak of 300,000), has also seen the effects of the decreasing populations. The refuge hosted numbers well over 100,000 until the mid-1980s then saw the peaks reduced by half in the 1990s.  The last three drought years have seen the peaks decline from 30,000 down to around 18,000.  The birds still concentrate in the northwest and northeast sections of the Pool.',

      "Lake Ophelia NWR (named for the largest water body in the area) was established in 1988 to protect the important Mississippi/Red River floodplain ecosystem. The refuge was once part of a vast bottomland hardwood wilderness. Levees have changed hydrology, but the underlying ridge/Saale topography supports a variety of habitat types. Bottomland hardwood forest, croplands, fallow fields, moist soil units, and cypress-tupelo brakes are intermixed with meandering bayous, pristine lakes, ponds, sloughs, and the Red River. This variety of vegetative communities in turn supports a diversity of wildlife. Due to its location in east-central Louisiana, the refuge is served by the Mississippi and Central Flyways. Although mallards, northern pintails, and wood ducks are the most numerous waterfowl species on the refuge, blue- and green-winged teal, northern shovelers, gadwall, and American Widgeon are also common. Primary diving ducks are scaup and ring-necked ducks. Canada, snow, and greater white-fronted geese are present, though less common. Several hundred native species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, fishes, and insects are found on the refuge. Common, though often difficult to see, species include bobcats, alligators, red and grey foxes, turkeys, mink, and otter. More frequently encountered are white-tailed deer, raccoons, fox squirrels, beaver, marsh hawks, and wading birds. Many neotropical migratory songbirds use the refuge at various times. Refuge fisheries are composed largely of largemouth bass, gar, crappie, bowfin, bream species, buffalo, carp, and catfish. Endangered species numbers are few and their presence is always marked with special interest. The arctic peregrine falcon is an occasional visitor, and thanks to the refuges three-year bald eagle reintroduction project, bald eagle sightings are common.",

With land surrounding the Patuxent and Little Patuxent Rivers between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD, the Refuge has grown from the original 2,670 acres to its present size of 12,750 acres and encompasses land formerly managed by the Departments of Agriculture and Defense. Throughout decades of change, Patuxent&apos;s mission of conserving and protecting the nation&apos;s wildlife and habitat through research and wildlife management techniques has remained virtually unchanged.        \tPatuxent Research Refuge supports a wide diversity of wildlife in forest, meadow, and wetland habitats. The land is managed to maintain biological diversity and to protect and benefit native and migratory bird species. During the fall and spring migrations, many waterfowl species stop to rest and feed. Over 270 species of birds occur on the Refuge. A nesting pair of bald eagles has used the North Tract of the Refuge since 1989.        \tIncreasing forest fragmentation in the area caused by urban development has damaged many populations of neotropical migratory birds. The Refuge is one of the largest forested areas in the mid-Atlantic region and provides critical breeding habitat and wintering habitat for these species.        \tPatuxent Research Refuge is divided into three areas: 1) North Tract, which offers hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, trails, and many interpretive programs 2) Central Tract, which contains the offices and study sites of many research biologists, and 3) South Tract, which has the National Wildlife Visitor Center and its trails.

In 1970 the Monomoy Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. As recently as 1958, this area was an extension of the mainland, the eroding shoreline at the elbow of Cape Cod. Severe winter storms isolated Monomoy Point from the mainland and, 20 years later, separated North Monomoy Island from South Monomoy Island. Ten miles of surf-beaten dunes on the eastern shore of the islands, still-shifting sands that sometimes reach 100 feet in height, give way to salt marsh and then to mudflats on the western shore. The ecosystem is a perfect habitat for migratory birds. Dubbed a sanctuary for wildlife in 1944, most of 7,604-acre Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge has been designated Wilderness: all of the north island and all but two tracts on the south island. The mainland portion of the refuge remains non-Wilderness. People are known to have lived here from 1711 on, and a lighthouse complex on the south island attests to their presence. Among the migratory birds you may see are grebes, shearwaters, petrels, gannets, bitterns, egrets, herons, swans, geese, ducks, and the endangered piping plover and roseate tern. Hundreds of gray and harbor seals winter along the coastline. Boaters swarm the shores in summer. Camping, fires, and pets are not permitted.",

      "Parker River National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1942 primarily to provide feeding, resting, and nesting habitat for migratory birds. Located along the Atlantic Flyway, the refuge is of vital stopover significance to waterfowl, shorebirds, and songbirds during pre- and postbreeding migratory periods.        The refuge occupies in part, the southern three-fourths of Plum Island, an 8 mile long barrier island near Newburyport, Massachusetts. Excellent wildlife-oriented recreational and educational opportunities are available with visitor facilities and programs provided to enhance your experience.        The refuge consists of 4,662 acres of diverse upland and wetland habitats including sandy beach and dune, shrub/thicket, bog, swamp, freshwater marsh, saltwater marsh and associated creek, river, mud flat, and salt panne. These and other refuge habitats support varied and abundant populations of resident and migratory wildlife including more than 300 species of birds and additional species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and plants.",

The Island is 1.6 miles long east to west, and about 1 mile north to south. Nomans Land Island was used for aerial gunnery by the U.S. Navy from 1942 to 1996.  The USFWS managed an "overlay" Refuge on the eastern third of the Island under a Joint Management Agreement between the Department of the Interior and Department of the Navy since 1975.  Following an extensive surface clearance of ordnance in 1997 and 1998, the Island was transferred to the USFWS to become Nomans Land Island National Wildlife Refuge.  It was established " . . . for use as an inviolate sanctuary, or for any other management purpose, for migratory birds" (Migratory Bird Conservation Act).        Nomans Land Island is surrounded entirely by the Atlantic Ocean. About 30% of the island is comprised of wetlands which range from emergent marshes to permanently flooded-open water.    There are four artificial ponds (that were impounded many years ago by early settlers), two large freshwater ponds, and a number of smaller ponds dot the Island. Common wetland plants include: Virginia chain fern, cranberry, sphagnum moss, broad-leaved cattail, and common reed.',

It is located in portions of the Towns of Hudson, Maynard, Stow and Sudbury and covers approximately 3.5 square miles. The Assabet River NWR consists of two separate pieces of land. The larger northern section is just north of Hudson Road. The southern section is located to the south of Hudson Road. The refuge is comprised of a diverse mixture of pine/hardwood forest, old field, and wetland habitats. On March 26, 2005, the refuge officially opened for wildlife dependent recreation. As of November 13, 2005, there are 10 miles of trails open to the public for wildlife observation. A map of existing trails is available at the kiosk on Hudson Road in Sudbury and at the refuge website.  The refuge is also open for hunting and will open for fishing in Spring 2006. Dogs are not allowed on the refuge. The Friends of the Assabet River NWR formed in 2000, nearly a full year prior to the transfer of the U.S. Armys former Fort Devens Sudbury Training Annex to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Since that time, the Friends Group has provided the refuge invaluable assistance in preparing to open the refuge for wildlife-dependent recreational activities by removing physical safety hazards; conducting biological surveys of vernal pools, raptors, bats, invasive plant species; and conducting numerous public outreach and education programs.  For information on becoming part of the Friends of the Assabet River NWR, contact Barbara Volkle at (508) 393-9251 or visit their website www.farnwr.org.",

      "Look in any direction at Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge and you look back to an earlier time along the Gulf Coast. The landscape is flat, like a prairie. The ground, blanketed with impervious clay soil, is waterlogged and acidic. Yet here, a rich, colorful blend of rare orchids, carnivorous plants and other ground cover thrive under the scattered pines in one of the most species-rich plant communities in North America. This is the wet pine savanna ecosystem – the critical habitat for endangered Mississippi sandhill cranes, migratory songbirds and waterfowl, and many other wildlife species. The refuge protects and restores the last remaining wet pine savanna in the United States, and thus, ensures the survival of the rare and magnificent Mississippi sandhill crane.",

Hamilton Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge is located in three counties (Noxubee, Oktibbeha, and Winston) and was originally created from lands obtained through the 1930s Resettlement Administration. With additional land acquisitions through the years, Noxubee now consists of 48,000 acres. Approximately 44,500 acres of the refuge is bottomland and upland forest. These forest lands are occupied by a variety of game species, including quail, deer, and turkey. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker relies on the Refuge for its existence in east-central Mississippi, In addition many neotropic bird species inhabit the Noxubee forests. Four green-tree reservoirs (GTRs), two major lakes (Bluff - 800 acres and Loakfoma - 400 acres), 16 small impoundments, and assorted wetland areas provide important habitat for wood stork, American alligator, bald eagle and wintering waterfowl.",

Included in those acres is one of the largest blocks (21,000 acres) of bottomland forest in the lower Mississippi River alluvial floodplain. The upland areas or ridges often crest at no more than one foot above swamp areas, and contain nuttall, willow and water oaks and other species while overcup oak, bitter pecan and ash dominate the transition zone from swamp to upland. Additional habitat types consist of reforested and agricultural areas.         In addition to providing resting and feeding areas for over 100,000 wintering waterfowl annually, the refuge also provides habitat for 200 species of neotropical migratory songbirds. Resident species making their home among the woodlands, sloughs, and reforested areas include the American alligator, white-tail deer, otter, swamp rabbit, wild turkey, squirrel, and other various small fur-bearers such as mink and raccoon.",

Topography is relatively flat and land has been subject to extensive clearing and drainage. Upon acquisition the refuge lands consited mostly of agricultural fields.  Since then, nearly 1,300 acres have been reforested.  The units largest continuous tract is a patchwork of cultivated farmlands, old fields, and small scattered hardwood bottomland forests bisected by the meandering Tippo Bayou that is its center piece.         The old oxbows and low-lying fields along Tippo Bayou flood each winter and hold large concentrations of waterfowl. Wood ducks abound here and the unit has a very healthy deer herd.  Peregrine falcon, bald eagles, merlin, least tern, black tern and wood stork occasionally pass through the refuge in migration. Eastern screech owls, barred owls, great-horned owls, loggerhead shrikes, and red-tailed hawks are common year-round residents.  Blue grosbeaks, dickcissels, and painted buntings can be seen during the summer months. Most of the agriculture land of the area is devoted to raising soybeans and rice, for the benefit of waterfowl.  The refuge is complimented on the south by the  9,483 acre Malmaison Wildlife Management Area managed by the State of Mississippi.",

      "Welcome to      Yazoo  National Wildlife Refuge    - the oldest national wildlife refuge in the State of Mississippi. This refuge was established in 1936 as one of the links in a chain of refuges that provide for the wintering needs of ducks and geese in the Mississippi Flyway. Yazoo NWR is also known as one of the premier hunting refuges in the southeastern U.S. For years, hunters have traditionally scheduled their vacations to hunt Yazoo NWRs white-tailed deer. You can learn more about Yazoo NWRs hunting programs in the Hunting Regulations for the Complex.         Yazoo NWR is also home-sweet-home to a healthy population of American alligators, a reptile species whose ancestry can be traced back to the age of the dinosaur. In early June the mama gators build nest mounds of dirt and vegetation in which they lay their eggs. Often these are in locations easily observed by the public. The mother alligator remains close to the nest, until the eggs hatch in late August or early September, to guard it from predators. During this period her protective instincts are heightened. None of our visitors has ever been hurt by an aggressive alligator, but if you should come across a nest, please keep your distance!",

      'The Fort Niobrara Wilderness now contains a total of 4,635 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Services Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge. All of the Wilderness is in the state of Nebraska. In 1976 the Fort Niobrara Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. Herds of bison and elk find sanctuary in the rolling sand hills of Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge. Little remains of the fort that once protected northern Nebraska settlers. The only surviving colonists, prairie dogs, have taken up residence in "dog towns" beneath the wildflower-scattered grasses. The Niobrara River flows swiftly through about nine miles of the refuge, creating a canyon riverine ecosystem of trees and bushes and attracting summer canoeists. From the south rim of the Niobrara River canyon and north to the refuge boundary, youll find the Fort Niobrara Wilderness, a unique mix of prairie and wooded valleys. Bison winter here, then head south of the river for the summer. Day-hikers can have a great adventure in the wilderness year round. No maintained trails offer access north of the river. The Fort Falls Trail is maintained on the south side of the river. The refuge is open only during daylight hours, and camping is prohibited.',

      'Boyer Chute National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was established to recover fish and wildlife habitat in and along the Missouri River. The purpose of the Boyer Chute Restoration Project is to restore essential wildlife habitat that became scarce when the Missouri River was "improved" for navigation half a century ago. River channelization, wetland drainage, and conversion of river bottom floodplain areas to agricultural, industrial, and municipal uses had resulted in the loss of over 500,000 acres of habitat along the navigable stretch of the Missouri River floodplain. The Boyer Chute project is a joint Federal and local conservation partnership success story. The project has restored the area to near pre-channelization condition without affecting navigation on the main stem of the Missouri River. Boyer Chute is once again a functioning part of the river. Close to 3,350 acres of floodplain woodland, tallgrass prairie, and wetland habitats now benefit Missouri River fishes, migratory birds, endangered species, and resident wildlife. Boyer Chute is self guiding. Floods in 2011 changed the look and the habitats of the refuge. The north and south sections of the auto tour loop are open.  The Sauger Fishing Pier along the south section of road is open, but the Catfish Fishing Pier just south of the Refuge Entrance will remain closed indefinitely.  Several parking areas are open, and the Main Parking Lot provides foot access via a concrete bridge across Boyer Chute Waterway onto the "Island"; over five miles of walking/hiking is available on the island portion of the refuge.',

      "The Brigantine Wilderness now contains a total of 6,681 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Services Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge. All of the Wilderness is in the state of New Jersey. In 1975 the Brigantine Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. In 1984, to posthumously honor a New Jersey conservationist congressman, Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge (established in 1939) and Barnegat National Wildlife Refuge (established in 1967) were combined to create the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge. Although the refuge consists of more than 39,000 acres, less than 7,000 acres in the southern division (the Brigantine) qualify as Wilderness. This trailless area, a tidal wetland and shallow bay habitat, is one of the most active flyways for migratory waterbirds in North America. Birdwatchers, binoculars in hand, have zoomed in on close to 300 species, including Atlantic brant and American black duck. The Wilderness also protects Holgate and Little Beaches, two of the few remaining barrier beaches in New Jersey. Grasses on these shores stabilize the fragile dunes and safeguard the rare piping plover, black skimmer, and least tern. The refuge is open during daylight hours, but there are prohibitions on camping, fires, horses, kite flying, swimming, flower picking, or anything else that might endanger the wildlife and their habitat. During nesting season (mid-April to mid-July), the area is closed to all public use. In the same protective vein, access to some portions is restricted to people with special-use permits for research and education.",

      'The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge Wilderness now contains a total of 3,660 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Services Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. All of the Wilderness is in the state of New Jersey. In 1968 the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. Roughly 25,000 years ago, where the Wisconsin Glacier reached its furthest point south and stopped, the creation of Great Swamp began. With cattail marshes, wet meadows, swamp woodlands, and ridges thick with oak, beech, and laurel, Great Swamp provides a home for 39 species of mammals including mice, moles, skunks, raccoons, otters, foxes, white-tailed deer, and the endangered Indiana bat. Migratory birds see Great Swamp as a "nest and rest" (244 species have been identified). Numerous reptiles and amphibians have taken up residence, including rare bog turtles, wood turtles, and blue-spotted salamanders. The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1960 following grassroots action to save the area from being developed into a major metropolitan airport. In 1968, the eastern half of the Refuge was designated as the very first Wilderness Area within the Department of the Interior. About 8.5 miles of primitive trails provide access during daylight hours only, and camping and picnicking are not permitted.',

      'The Cape May National Wildlife Refuge is strategically located to conserve habitat for hundreds of thousands of migratory birds which pass through the area each year.  As the New Jersey Coast and the Cape May Peninsula witness the loss of natural habitat, the refuge, in concert with various partners, is working to ensure that important habitats are preserved.  These efforts will provide opportunities for future generations of Americans to enjoy the spectacular concentrations of shorebirds, songbirds, raptors, and waterfowl which have made the Cape May area famous for birdwatching. These areas are considered so important that refuge lands are included in the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, a "Ramsar" Wetland of International Importance, part of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network, the Pinelands National Reserve, an Important Bird Area, within the Great Egg Harbor National Scenic and Recreational River, and a destination on the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route.',

      "Forsythe NWR, located 10 miles north of Atlantic City, is composed of two separate Divisions, Barnegat in the north and Brigantine in the south.  The Brigantine and Barnegat Divisions were originally two distinct refuges, established in 1939 and 1967 respectively, to provide important wintering habitat for waterfowl, especially black ducks and Atlantic brant. The Divisions were combined in 1984 under the Edwin B. Forsythe name, in honor of the late conservationist Congressman from New Jersey.  The refuge complex covers approximately 46,000 acres in three counties including Atlantic, Burlington, and Ocean. Nearly 80 percent of Forsythe Refuge is tidal salt meadow and marsh, interspersed with shallow coves and bays. Most of the remainder of the refuge acreage is woodlands dominated by pitch pines, oaks, and white cedar, with some fields which are maintained to provide habitat diversity.  More than 6,000 acres are designated as Wilderness Area. This includes Holgate and Little Beach, two of the few remaining undeveloped barrier beaches in New Jersey. These pristine sites provide critical nesting habitat for threatened piping plovers and a wide variety of other beachnesting species. Beaches and dunes provide nesting habitat for piping plovers, black skimmers and least terns. Occasionally peregrine falcons, bald eagles and osprey are seen. Each spring and fall, thousands of water birds stop at Forsythe Refuge during their long migrations.  Waterfowl, wading birds, and shore birds may be viewed from the Wildlife Drive as they feed and rest.  Refuge uplands also provide important stopover habitat for migrating passerines. Forsythe is a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site, a Wetlands of International Importance site under the Ramsar Convention, and an important birding area. It also is a part of The Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve and The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail. In 2002 the refuge was the recipient of the New Jersey Governors Eco-Tourism Award.",

Supawna Meadows NWR is located along the Delaware River estuary just north of the Salem River in Salem County, NJ. The Delaware Bay and estuary is recognized as a    wetlands of international importance and an international shorebird reserve. The refuge currently owns approximately 2,800 acres within the 4,600 acre approved boundary.  The brackish tidal marshes that make up nearly 80 percent of the refuge provide waterfowl with an important feeding and resting area, particularly during the fall and spring migrations.  Black ducks, mallards and northern pintails are common winter visitors.  Sandpipers and other shorebirds use the refuge    marshes as a feeding area during the summer as well as during the spring and fall migrations.  Delawares nearby Pea Patch Island Rookery hosts over 6,000 pairs of nine species, making it the largest rookery of colonial wading birds on the east coast north of Florida.  The refuge marshes provide valuable foraging habitat for these colonial wading birds during the nesting season.        Warblers, sparrows and other migratory birds use the upland areas of the refuge as resting and feeding areas during migration and for nesting during the summer.  Thousands of tree swallows forage on the refuge in the late summer.  Ospreys, bald eagle, northern harrier, short-eared owl and barn owl nest on the refuge.",

Located between Syracuse and Rochester, in Seneca and Wayne Counties, Montezuma serves as a major resting area for waterfowl and other waterbirds on their journeys to and from nesting areas in northeastern and east-central Canada. Fall peaks of Canada geese reach over 60,000 birds; in spring this number has exceeded 100,000.  Spring migration peaks of snow geese have recently exceeded 100,000 birds.  Late fall use by mallards has exceeded 100,000 birds.  Use by American black ducks in the fall often reaches 25,000. Bald eagles have resided on the refuge since 1986, first producing offspring in 1987. Several pair of osprey also nest on the refuge.  There are established nesting colonies of black terns, black-crowned night-herons, and great blue herons.  Dewatered refuge impoundments provide significant foraging habitat for shorebirds during the late summer and fall. Currently, the refuge consists of more than 8,000 acres as efforts to restore and preserve the marsh continue with the Montezuma Wetlands Complex. This project involves the Service, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, conservation organizations, corporations, and private landowners, all working together to restore and enhance wetland habitats and the populations of wetland-dependant wildlife on 36,050 acres of the former Montezuma Marsh. The Montezuma Wetlands Complex is part of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, an international agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico that seeks to restore, conserve, and enhance wetland habitats and waterfowl populations throughout North America.  The National Audubon Society recognized the Montezuma Wetlands Complex as its first Important Bird Area in New York, as well as a Globally Important Bird Area.",

Local Attractions of Interest   The home of Peter Conser, leader of the famed Choctaw Lighthorse police or soldiers is located three miles west of Hodgens. Conser operated a blacksmith shop, gristmill, general store, and post office. Excellent horses were always kept in the rail corral around the barn for the Choctaw Lighthorsemen.   The home of the late US Senator and Mrs. Robert S. Kerr is located about five miles southwest of Poteau. The magnificent mansion, containing many of the late Senators office furnishings and personal items, is now the Kerr museum, conference center, and a bed and breakfast facility.   Also in this area is the Heavener Runestone. The runestone is believed to be a land claim made by a Viking explorer prior to 1000 A.D. It is located in the Heavener Runestone State Park near the city of Heavener.   The nearby Quachita Mountains is a gateway to the beautiful Quachita National Forest. Located within the National Forest is the Winding Stair National Scenic Byway.",

Over 250 housing developments with lake homes are located in close proximity to the shoreline. Most of these areas are within walking distance to the lake. Many offer public boat ramp access within the development. Mowing and boat dock permits allow property owners to mow government property below their lots and place private boat docks within walking distance of their property.   Eufaula Lake has long been recognized for its outstanding fishery. Crappie, sand bass, catfish and black bass in the lake reach record size. Below the dam, striped bass reaching over 40 pounds have been caught in the tailwaters. This fishery is popular year-round with catfish, sand bass and crappie being the most popular species.   Visitors to Eufaula Lake should plan to take advantage of the opportunity to sight see in the historic town of Eufaula, where many antique shops and unique restaurants offer something for everyone. Other points of interest include the towns of McAlester and Krebs, where Italian restaurants are known worldwide.   Robbers Cave State Park and two state parks located on Eufaula Lake offer a variety of recreational experiences, including golf courses, swimming pools, and hiking trails. Visitors in the fall will be treated to a collage of colors as the surrounding hills provide unparalleled beauty of fall foliage.",

      'The Wichita Mountains Wilderness now contains a total of 8,570 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Services Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge. All of the Wilderness is in the state of Oklahoma. In 1970 the Wichita Mountains Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. Of the refuges 59,020 acres, 22,400 acres are open to public use. The rest of the refuge is a special-use area reserved for the wild animals. In 1901 this area was proclaimed a "Forest Preserve," and in 1905 President Theodore Roosevelt signed a law creating the first "Game Sanctuary" here for the almost-extinct Bison bison. Thanks to careful management, a remnant bunch of 15 buffalo has grown to a maintained herd of about 650, which live among the rugged rocky outcroppings, oak forests, and the mixed-grass prairie of the refuge. Within the northern portion of the special-use area lies North Mountain Wilderness Unit. The rugged southwestern corner of the refuge is protected as Charons Garden Wilderness Unit and is open to the public. The outstanding and unique scenic qualities of this wilderness unit attract many visitors.',

      'Located approximately 12 miles offshore on picturesque Block Island, this small refuge provides important habitat for wildlife, and a place for people to appreciate the natural environment of the island.  The refuge was established in 1973 with the transfer of 28 acres from the U.S. Coast Guard, and has grown to its current size of 127 acres today. Block Island National Wildlife Refuge is administered as part of the Rhode Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex, which manages all five of the National Wildlife Refuges in Rhode Island, and is headquartered in Charlestown, Rhode Island. The new Kettle Pond Visitor Center and headquarters located in Charlestown, RI,which opened in October 2005,  celebrates the  John H. Chafee National Wildlife Refuge and all of the other refuges in Rhode Island. This facility contains interactive exhibits, displays, a sales area, classrooms for speciel events, and knowledgeable people where visitors can come and explore the refuges and learn about the wildlife resources and coastal environments of each refuge. Refuge lands on Block Island are most notable for the large concentration (over 70 species) of migratory songbirds which visit the area each fall.  Located in the Atlantic flyway, many young, inexperienced songbirds "overfly" the mainland and stopover on Block Island before continuing their migration.  The result is a cornucopia of young migratory songbirds from a variety of  different species. Block Island is internationally recognized as one of the most important migratory bird habitats on the east Coast, attracting hundreds of "birders" to the Island each fall. The refuge also provides habitat for the Endangered American Burying Beetle, supporting the only population of this species known East of the Mississippi River.   Piping plover occur on the Island (a threatened Species) as do four other State species of concern.   The refuge is also home to the largest gull colony in Rhode Island.',

      "Wisconsin, famed for its 84,000 miles of rivers that meander through varying terrain and its 15,000 lakes, is full of places to paddle, float, and fish. Many islands in this region were omitted from the original land surveys conducted in the 1830s and 1840s. Because of this, there is a mixing of ownership between state-owned, privately owned islands. For those under federal management, the BLM administers to almost 500 islands throughout the area.  Because of this varied ownership, its critical that visitors determine whether an island is public land before using it. The flowages between Stevens Point and Nekoosa are chock-full of more than 60 public islands, ranging from small, low patches of willows and alder, to large stands of mixed pines and hardwoods. Below Castle Rock Lake, the islands down to Prairie du Sac are mostly floodplain forests with broad sandbars that invite paddler-campers. A few of these islands have remnant prairie and savanna vegetation.   Many public islands are perfect fishing spots, lunch stops for your next float trip, or overnight campsites. However, there are no visitor services at any of these locations; as such, it is important to plan accordingly.  If you have any questions about visiting the islands, please call (414) 297-4400.  Would you like to volunteer as a BLM public island steward? Contact Derek Strohl, dstrohl@blm.gov",

      "Wisconsin, with its 84,000 miles of rivers and 15,000 lakes, is full of places to paddle, float, fish, or just watch and listen. The BLM has a share in all this beauty, as we manage almost 500 islands in Wisconsins rivers and lakes. Many islands in this region were omitted from the original land surveys conducted in the 1830s and 1840s, and we don t manage all of them. Many of the islands we do manage are close to other state-owned and privately owned islands, so its critical that visitors determine whether an island is public land before using it.   The flowages between Stevens Point and Nekoosa are chock-full of more than 60 public islands, ranging from small, low patches of willows and alder, to large stands of mixed pines and hardwoods.  Below Castle Rock Lake, the islands down to Prairie du Sac are mostly floodplain forests with broad sandbars that invite paddler-campers.  A few of these islands have remnant prairie and savanna vegetation.   Many public islands are perfect fishing spots, lunch stops for your next float trip, or overnight campsites. Future management plans include the posting signs so recreationists may know which ones are available for public use and local restrictions, if any.   Would you like to volunteer as a BLM public island steward? Contact Derek Strohl, dstrohl@blm.gov.",

There is a new sign system with fresh markings on all the old trails.  There have been 7 new trails constructed ranging from tough, techy and tight singletrack to fast flowing and open singletrack.  Check out some of the major rockwork done on some of the trails! The Klondike Bluffs Trail System has two sections Klondike North and Klondike South.  The southern section is about  17 miles from Moab and the northern section is a few miles beyond that.  Both have signs.  The trails are a mixture of tough climbs and descents and smooth fast singltrack working along some of the uplifted rocks in the area.  Very fun, especially in cooler weather. There is no fee to ride the Klondike Bluffs Trails, however the BLM, the USFS, Grand County Trail Mix and all the local riders would appreciate if you keep these trails nice by staying on them, cleaning up after yourself and others and not riding them if it is too muddy.  Trail Mix especially has put alot of time and effort into transforming this trail system.  They always love volunteers even if it is just you picking up trash on your ride.  Thanks!",

      'The "Moab Daily" is a popular 13-mile section of the Colorado River that runs from Hittle Bottom Recreation Area to Take Out Boat Ramp and parallels state Route 128. This stretch features easy boater access, close proximity to the city of Moab, moderate rapids, and wonderful scenery. Depending on water levels, rapids on this section range from Class I to Class III. No permits are required for private trips.  There are a number of commercial outfitters who have permits from the Moab BLM Field Office to offer guided trips on this section of the river.   State of Utah Boating Law requires all boaters to wear life vests.  Current streamflow conditions are available on the U.S Geological Survey website. The BLM maintains parking areas, boat ramps, and campgrounds along the entire stretch, including Hittle Bottom, Rocky Rapid (a.k.a. Ida Gulch), Sandy Beach, and Take Out Boat Ramps.  Special regulations apply for boaters wishing to camp along the "Daily" section. Overnight camping on river right (facing downstream) is allowed only in designated sites between Dewey Bridge and Salt Wash (the boundary of Arches National Park). On river left, people must camp in BLM developed campgrounds (dispersed camping is not allowed on this side of the river in order to protect resources).  Here is a map to help plan your activities along the "Moab Daily". For those wanting a longer trip, the 7.5 mile Dewey Bridge to Hittle Bottom stretch of the Colorado River offers flat water and great views. Roughly half of the trip is within sight of Fisher Towers and the La Sal Mountains. There is a developed, but steep, boat ramp at the Dewey Bridge Campground (please use caution with vehicles) and boater parking is available. No fee is charge for use of this boat ramp. All BLM individual camp sites are first-come, first-served. Group sites are reservable one year in advance but no more than 8 days before the desired arrival date through Recreation.gov (hint: search on "Hittle Bottom Group Sites" and all reservable sites in the area will be listed).',

      "The Tabeguache (pronounced TAB-a-watch) Trail crosses public land for 142 miles, connecting Montrose and Grand Junction, Colorado.  The trail begins in Shavano Valley and weaves through the canyons, mesas, and highlands of the Uncompahgre Plateau before ending in No Thoroughfare Canyon, a few miles west of Grand Junction.  The trail is marked by brown fiberglass posts approximately every mile, and at all intersections. Most of the trail is on remote lands administered by the U.S. Forest Service and BLM.  The adventurous nature of this trail requires users to be cautious, personally responsible, and self-sufficient and have a working knowledge of backcountry survival. The use of topographic maps, a compass and/or GPS unit is strongly recommended.  Carry plenty of drinking water as it is not readily available along the trail. To reduce damage to the resource, you are encouraged to avoid the area when wet conditions exist. It is difficult, but not impossible, for high-clearance 4-wheel drive vehicles to travel all but single-track sections of the trail. Users are urged to respect all property rights by closing gates, being watchful for livestock, and camping only in approved camping areas. Users should also be aware that the Uncompahgre Plateau is a nationally renowned hunting area, and during the hunting season, it is highly recommended that you wear orange hats and jackets. Check state hunting dates with the Colorado Division of Wildlife before beginning your trip. For more information, please contact the Uncompahgre and Grand Junction Field Offices, or the Colorado Plateau Mountain Bike Trail Association (COPMOBA), which has produced a brochure for the entire trail.",

      "Located just west of Montrose, Colorado, the Buzzard Gulch Trail System has evolved into a wonderful renewed resource for non-motorized trail users.  The landscape is classic canyon country -alternating between rocky and sandy terrain- with elevations ranging from 6,200 to 6,800 feet.  Sparse pinyon, juniper, and big sagebrush offer limited opportunities for shade.  While Spring Canyon Trailhead provides the best access, the trail system can also be reached from the Lower Spring Creek Trailhead along Dave Wood Road. Designed and constructed as part of the Dry Creek Travel Management Plan implementation, the trail system is categorized as Non-Motorized Single Track, defined as routes of 36 inches wide or less intended for mechanized modes of transportation (such as mountain bikes), as well as foot and horse travel.  Modest elevation changes provide a moderately easy challenge for mountain bikers. for more information, please contact the Uncompahgre Field Office.",

      "Fruitgrowers Reservoir was created by Fruitgrowers Dam which crosses Alfalfa Run.  Alfalfa Runs natural flow is augmented by diversions from Surface and Dry Creeks.  The reservoir is the main feature of the Fruitgrowers Dam Project.  Visitation is estimated at roughly 500 people per year.  There are about 5 miles of shoreline, 4 of which are open to recreation.  No water contact activities are allowed.  Average elevation is about 5,400 feet above sea level.  The site has only primitivefacilities and no on-site manager or law enforcement.In the spring, Fruitgrowers Reservoir wildlife viewing area offers a spectacular sight with thousands of sandhill cranes stopping over on their way north.  The reservoir hosts the largest nesting colony of western grebes in Colorado and more than 200 species of birds have been sighted.  Also, a variety of mammals (i.e., mule deer, fox, mink) and reptiles make the area their home.  There is a hard-surface watchable wildlife trail, about 750 feet long with turnout. Brochures for Fruitgrowers and other Grand Junction areas may be acquired by contacting the Grand Junction Visitor and Convention Bureau.

      'Kakahaia Refuge is a coastal freshwater pond, originally used as an artificial fish pond. This 44-acre refuge is situated on the south coast of Molokai. Established in 1977, it provides habitat for the endangered alae keokeo (Hawaiian coot) and small numbers of aeo (Hawaiian stilt), migratory waterfowl, and shorebirds. Northern pintails are common in winter months; and the Pacific golden plover is the most common shorebird. The native black-crowned night heron feeds on fish and other small vertebrates along the shoreline. Kakahaia is primarily a natural, spring-fed habitat. However, in 1983, an additional impoundment was constructed to increase shallow water habitat for the endangered stilt. In 1998 and 1999, this "New Pond" was cleared of invasive plants to open up habitat for the endangered stilt and coot, as well as wintering birds. State Route 450 bisects the refuge. The 2 acres seaward of the highway are under special use permit to the County of Maui for use as a county park open to picnicking and shoreline fishing.',

In wilderness, you can enjoy challenging recreational activities and extraordinary opportunities for solitude. In an age of  &quot;...increasing population, accompanied by expanding settlement and growing mechanization,...&quot;  you play an important role in helping to  &quot;...secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness&quot;  as called for by Congress in the Wilderness Act of 1964. Please follow the regulations in place for this area, and use Leave No Trace techniques when visiting to ensure protection of its unique natural and experiential qualities. How to follow the seven standard Leave No Trace principles differs in different parts of the country (desert vs. Rocky Mountains).

      "Silver Reef Mining DistrictJohn Kemple arrived in Harrisburg in 1866, and boarded at the Orson Adams House for the winter. Kemple was an experienced prospector, and in 1868 he found a mineralized sandstone float (an ore unattached to the bedrock) that assayed very high in silver, but he had a hard time pinpointing its source. He returned in 1870, and discovered silver in the White Reef, at the Southern base of Pine Valley Mountain. But because the silver was in sandstone, which at the time was considered impossible, assayers were skeptical of his findings, which slowed the process for locating the source of his supplies. In 1874, John Kemple took the lead in organizing a new mining district called the Harrisburg Mining District, and Orson B. Adams was elected president. The first claim recorded within this district, was only about 300 hundred yards southwest from the Orson Adams House and was named Pride of the West Ledge and Kemple Company. Two years later, by early 1876, a surge of silver fever took off, and miners, along with supporting industries, flowed into the area.With the closest railroad a 100 miles away in Milford, on-site transformation of silver ore into bullion was crucial. The nearest mills were more than 300 miles away, so it was decided to build mills near the mines, process the ore, and then ship finished bullion to the railroad by wagon. Three of the five mills were built in Silver Reef, with one in Leeds and the other on the Virgin River, named Stormont Mill. Mines that would not pay before the mills came were now considered valuable property. During 1876, Silver Reef was one of the largest towns in Washington County, with about 1,500 residents. A development boom took place along mile-long Main Street, including the construction of 6 saloons, 9 grocery stores, 2 dance halls, a brewery, a billiard hall, the Wells Fargo Express Office, a jail, and a church, amongst many others. St. John Catholic Church was Southern Utah’s first established Catholic congregation, founded in 1879, which housed the town’s hospital in a rear wing. Only remnants of the church can still be seen. Town advocates wanted Silver Reef to become the county seat, but the more conservative citizens of neighboring towns, established by members of the LDS church, were against it.  As a typical boomtown, Silver Reef grew as quickly as it dwindled down. Reduced operations continued through 1909, after which mining completely stopped, and livestock owners took their place. When the town went extinct, neighboring town residents burrowed the leftover buildings and took the materials for their own use.",

      "This expanse of public land offers stunning canyon vistas and a unique hiking opportunity. By following the East Fork of the Virgin River, you can hike over ten miles through the canyons into the east side of Zion National Park. Bear in mind to check with the Park concerning fees. Also, the Park currently maintains a research area immediately downstream of the WSA that is closed to backcountry use. The northern half of Parunuweap is heavily wooded with pinyon and juniper with a jeep trail leading down into the canyon. This route should only be taken by people experienced in driving on rough mountain roads. The main landmarks in and directly south of the southern portion of the WSA are Harris Mountain and Elephant Butte. Again, springs and plant life concentrate animals in the area. Mule deer are common, and with the mule deer come predatory mountain lions. Many kinds of hawks, eagles and other birds can also be seen in the area. Beware, however, since rattlesnakes are also common here. Special Features: A major historical feature is the Elephant Gap or Foote Ranch Road, believed to follow the pioneer route between Pipe Spring, Arizona, and Long Valley, Utah. About 4.5 miles of this route are cherry-stemmed from the WSA and 4 miles are considered to be a way within the WSA.   The state sensitive bald eagle occasionally roosts in the WSA in the winter.   The peregrine falcon may nest within the WSA.   The golden eagle may also sometimes inhabit or nest in the WSA.   Other state sensitive or USFWS candidate or threatened animal species that may inhabit the WSA include ferruginous hawk, Mexican spotted owl, western yellow-billed cuckoo, and Bells vireo.   USFWS candidate, threatened or endangered plant species that may occur in the WSA are Asplenium andrewsii, Erigeron sionis, Heterotheca jonesii, and Sphaeromeria ruthia.",

A second pond was constructed on the Refuge in 1983 to provide additional darter habitat.   The Refuge is unstaffed and administered by Wheeler NWR.            The watercress darter is a small, very colorful fish measuring up to 2.5 inches in length.  The fish is currently found in only four sites in the upper Black Warrior River drainage near Birmingham, Alabama.  They are found only at mid-depths in dense accumulations of aquatic vegetation including watercress, in springs and spring runs.  Green sunfish, bluegills, and sculpins are known to prey on watercress darters.  The darters feed on snails, crustaceans, and insect larvae that inhabit springs and spring runs.",

      'Stewart B. McKinney NWR is comprised of ten different units that are stretched across Connecticuts shoreline.  The headquarters is located approximately 45 minutes south of Hartford and 30 minutes east of New Haven in Westbrook, CT.         Salt Meadow NWR was established in 1972 and redesignated by Congress as the Connecticut Coastal National Wildlife Refuge in 1984.  The refuge was renamed in 1987 to honor the late U.S. Congressman Stewart B. McKinney, who was instrumental in its establishment. The ten units of the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge span 70 miles of Connecticut coastline.         Located in the Atlantic Flyway, the refuge provides important resting, feeding, and nesting habitat for many species of wading birds, shorebirds, songbirds and terns, including the endangered roseate tern.  Adjacent waters serve as wintering habitat for brant, scoters, American black duck and other waterfowl.  Overall, the refuge encompasses over 800 acres of barrier beach, tidal wetland and fragile island habitats.        Salt Meadow Unit, in Westbrook, CT, and Falkner Island Unit, three miles off the coast of Guilford, CT, have both been designation as an "Important Bird Area" by the National Audubon Society.  Falkner Island Unit is home to over 124 pairs of nesting Federally Endangered Roseate Terns and over 3000 nesting pairs of common terns.  Salt Meadow Unit is used by over 280 species of migrating neotropical birds during the spring and fall migrations.',

      "Blackbeard Island  was acquired by the Navy Department at public auction in 1800 as a source of live oak timber for ship building. In 1924 the island was placed under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Biological Survey to be maintained as a preserve and breeding ground for native wildlife and migratory birds.  A presidential proclamation in 1940 changed its designation from Blackbeard Island Reservation to Blackbeard Island National Wildlife Refuge.  In 1975, three thousand acres of the refuge were set aside as National Wilderness.  Blackbeard Island was named for Edward Teach, alias Balckbeard the Pirate. Rumors of Blackbeards buried treasure still flourish, but no evidence of his fortune has ever been discovered. The island is comprised of interconnecting linear dunes thickly covered by oak/palmetto vegetation. There are approximately 1,163 acres of open freshwater or freshwater marsh, 2,000 acres of regularly flooded salt marsh, 2,115 acres of maritime forest, and 340 acres of sandy beach. The primary objectives of the refuge are to provide wintering habitat and protection for migratory birds; provide protection and habitat to promote resident and migratory wildlife diversity; and to provide protection and management for endangered and threatened species (loggerhead sea turtle, American bald eagle, wood stork, piping plover).  Notable concentrations of waterfowl, wading birds, shorebirds, songbirds, raptors, deer, and alligators can be seen at various times of the year.",

Clear streams and beaver ponds provide ideal wetland habitat for waterfowl and other wetland dependent species. Today the forest and native wildlife populations have been restored from what was originally abandoned farm land. The refuge serves as a model of forest ecosystem management for wildlife. The red-cockaded woodpecker, a native bird of the southern US, is an endangered species because the old growth pine forests it requires for nesting and roosting have been logged throughout most of its range. The refuge currently has 35 active clans (family groups). Prescribed burning and thinning are two forest management practices used to provide habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker. Many migratory bird species, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and other native wildlife benefit from these management practices. The diversity of habitats provides a haven for nearly 200 species of birds and 50 species of mammals.",

Salt marsh and tidal creeks separate the refuge from the mainland and Skidaway Island to the west.        Refuge visitors may enjoy recreational activities such as birdwatching, beachcombing, hiking and general nature studies.  The 20 miles of dirt roads on Wassaw Island and seven miles of beach provides an ideal wildlife trail system for hikers.  Birdwatching is particularly fruitful during the spring and fall migrations.        The island supports rookeries for egrets and herons, and a variety of wading birds are abundant in the summer months.  In summer, telltale tracks on Wassaws beach attest to nocturnal visits by the threatened loggerhead sea turtles which come ashore for egg laying and then return secretively to the sea.",

      "DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge is part of a network of refuges devoted to preserving and restoring increasingly scarce habitat for migratory waterfowl and other wildlife.  The refuge is comprised of 8,358 acres in Iowa and Nebraska and lies in the Missouri River Valley floodplain on a former meander of the Missouri River. Each year, especially during the fall, spectacular flights of ducks and geese mark the changing seasons along this traditional waterfowl flyway. An interesting assortment of warblers, raptors, shorebirds, and other bird life can be observed also. The 1968 excavation of the steamboat Bertrand, which sank in 1865, adds a major historical emphasis to the refuge program. The 200,000 pieces in the Bertrand Collection provide one of the most significant assemblages of Civil War era artifacts in the country. A former oxbow of the Missouri River, DeSoto Lake, provides recreational use for up to 250,000 visitors annually. The DeSoto Visitor Center provides an introduction to the refuge, exhibits the Bertrand Collection, and contains interpretive displays on the historical development of the Missouri River Basin, the ecological impacts of that development, and the natural history of the area.",

      'The "driftless area" of the Upper Midwest derives its name from the fact that it was unglaciated during the most recent glacial event about 12,000 years ago. Glaciers surrounded but did not pass over this land. Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1989 to protect the Federally endangered Iowa Pleistocene snail and threatened northern monkshood plant. Habitats that support these species are also home to other glacial-relict snail and plant species that require specific cool moist conditions to live. These species occur only on algific talus slopes or moist sandstone cliffs. In these fragile places, constant cold air exiting from a cliff or talus slope creates a unique microclimate, one that may be considerably different from areas only meters away. The refuge is currently 775 acres, consisting of nine units in four counties in northeastern Iowa. When the proposed acquisition is completed, at least 70 percent of the known northern monkshood population and 75 percent of the known population of the Iowa Pleistocene snail will be protected. The ultimate goal is recovery and removal of both species from the Federal list of endangered and threatened species.',

      "The Iowa Wetland Management District is part of Union Slough National Wildlife Refuge and is very different from other wetland management districts. Under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (State), the State manages the waterfowl production areas (WPAs) in the district. This is a partnership that has been very beneficial to the Service. Together, the State and the Service have been able to develop large complexes of habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife species. Although the Wetland Management District encompasses 35 counties, at this date, there are WPAs in 16 counties. Most acquisitions are intended to increase habitat at existing wetland complexes, so it is unlikely that tracts will be acquired in the entire 35-county area. Most WPAs are small, from 100 to 500 acres, but several have grown considerably. Union Hills WPA in Cerro Gordo County is the largest in Iowa at over 2,000 acres. Spring Run, a large complex of State and Federal lands in Dickinson County, is the second largest WPA. Dugout Creek WPA in Dickinson County and Lower Morse Lake in Wright County are also among the larger restored tracts in the Iowa Wetland Management District.",

      'Union Slough National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1937 to provide a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. The actual slough is all that remains of a pre-glacial riverbed, and its name is derived from the connection or "union" of two watersheds: the Blue Earth River of Minnesota and the East Fork of the Des Moines River. The terrain is nearly flat, allowing the flow of the water to be determined by the direction of the wind at times. The refuge is on the eastern edge of the tallgrass prairie region of the Northern Great Plains. Common native range plants are bluestems, gramas, Indiangrass, coneflowers, butterfly milkweed, and leadplant, to name a few. The refuge is a major producer of wood ducks, with approximately 2,500 produced annually, and also has been the site of several successful reintroductions of the trumpeter swan. This 3,334-acre refuge surrounded by a sea of corn and soybeans provides vital habitat for a variety of plants and animals.',

The Refuge is named after the Marais des Cygnes River which runs through the middle of the Refuge and is the dominant natural feature of the region.  The term "marais des cygnes" comes from the French language and means "marsh of the swans."  It is presumed that trumpeter swans, which were historically common in the Midwest, used the wetlands adjacent to the Marais des Cygnes River during spring and fall migration. The Refuge offers visitors the chance to view bottomland hardwood forest and tallgrass prairie.  Both of these plant communities are rare in North America today.  Bottomland hardwood forest has been reduced by 80 percent nationally since Euro-American settlement, and tallgrass prairie has been reduced by 99 percent.',

The refuge was established in 1986 to provide for 1) conservation and management of all fish and wildlife within the refuge, 2) to fulfill the international treaty obligations of the United States with respect to fish and wildlife, and 3) to provide opportunities for scientific research, environmental education, and fish and wildlife oriented recreation, including hunting, fishing and trapping, birdwatching, nature photography, and others. The refuge is encompassed within nearly one-half million acres of hardwood swamps, lakes and bayous.   The natural floodplain of the Atchafalaya River flows for 140 miles south from its junction with the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.   The basins dense bottomland hardwoods, cypress-tupelo swamps, overflow lakes, and meandering bayous provide a tremendous diversity of habitat for more than 200 species of resident and migratory birds and numerous other wildlife and the area has been recognized as an Internationally Important Bird Area.  The basins wooded wetlands also provide vital nesting habitat for wood ducks, and support the nations largest concentration of American woodcock.   Eagles, ospreys,  swallow-tailed kites, and Mississippi kites can occasionally be seen soaring overhead.  Wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, gray and fox squirrels, eastern cottontail, swamp rabbit, gray and red fox, coyote, striped skunk, and opposum inhabit the refuge, as do a small remnant population of black bears.  Furbearers found in this great swamp are raccoon, mink, bobcat, nutria, muskrat, river otter, and beaver. The lifeblood of the fishery is the basins annual flooding and dewatering cycle.  Overflows occur during the winter and spring rains, with many areas gradually becoming dewatered during the summer and fall. Sportfishing is popular throughout the basin.  Largemouth bass, white crappie, black crappie, warmouth, bluegill, redear sunfish, and channel catfish  are the primary species sought.  More than 85 species of fish occur in the basin, and their populations frequently exceed 1,000 pounds per acre.

      "On June 30, 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed Public Law 96-288 authorizing the 40,000-acre Bogue Chitto National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Washington and St. Tammany Parishes, LA, and Pearl River County, MS. Since that time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been acquiring bottomland hardwood habitat in the Pearl River Basin. On December 13, 1989, Congress authorized a boundary expansion for Bogue Chitto NWR that included an additional 8,400 acres of bottomland hardwoods in St. Tammany Parish. To date, some 36,447 acres have been placed under refuge management. The refuge is still in an acquisition phase. White-tail deer, squirrel, turkey and hog hunting and fishing is offered to the public. The endangered and threatended species found on the refuge are bald eagle, ringed-sawback turtle, gopher tortoise, inflated heelsplitter mussel, and gulf sturgeon.  Access is primarily by boat on the refuges Louisiana side and road access is available on the refuges Mississippi side.  In Summer 2002, a new walking trail was unveiled on the Louisiana side of the Refuge.  This 3/4 of a mile walking trail offers a unique journey into the interior of Bogue Chittos majestic habitat. Bogue Chitto NWR is primarily composed of bottomland hardwood habitat interlaced by the Bogue Chitto and Pearl River Systems.  Numerous sloughs, bayous and lakes are located on the refuge.  Water levels fluctuate by several feet from their low point in the summer to winter/spring flood stage.  Over 90% of the refuge can be flooded during seasonal high river periods.  The mixed hardwood forest includes water oak, overcup oak, American elm, sweetgum, and swamp red maple on higher elevations and bald cypress, tupelo gum, and swamp blackgum along the wettest areas.  Mid-story in mixed hardwoods includes ironwood, arrowwood, Virginia willow and reproduction of the overstory.  Typical mid-story plants along the sloughs and bayous are buttonbush, swamp privet, and water elm. The Refuge offers hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, hiking, primitive streamside camping, birding, photography and canoeing.",

      "DArbonne National Wildlife Refuge, located north of West Monroe, Louisiana, lies on the western edge of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.  It was established in 1975 to protect bottomland hardwoods and provide wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl.  Additionally the refuge provides habitat for alligators, bald eagles, the little known Rafinesques big-eared bat and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.   The refuge is bisected by 13 miles of Bayou DArbonne, a stream in the Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System, and is crisscrossed by numerous creeks, sloughs and oxbow lakes.  Cypress swamps, bottomland hardwood and upland forests complete the landscape that is habitat for a diverse group of plants and animals.  DArbonne NWR also has the national record mayhaw tree, a wetland species with fruit that makes delicious jelly.  DArbonne is one of four refuges managed in the North Louisiana Refuges Complex.        In years of normal or above rainfall, the refuges bottomland hardwood forest is a very important overflow area for the Ouachita River basin.  High water levels, which usually occur between January and May, can flood up to 87% of the refuge. The wetland forests not only provide habitat to wetland dependent wildlife, but they also reduce damage from flooding in developed areas, they filter silt and other particles from the water, they help neutralize pollutants in the water, and they provide recharge areas for aquifers (natural underground water storage areas).",

Its boundary was and still is rather loosely described as "... a small group of    unsurveyed islets located in the Gulf of Mexico about three and one half miles south of Marsh Island, LA,    and approximately at latitude 29 degrees 26 minutes north, longitude 91 degrees 51 minutes west from    Greenwich..." The boundary of the refuge has been interpreted to be those areas in this vicinity that are above    mean high tide.         For a number of years, there has been only one islet at this location. This islet is composed    almost entirely of shell fragments. It is extremely dynamic and builds or recedes with passing storms.    Vegetation is almost entirely lacking. Birds known to nest here include royal terns, sandwich terns, black    skimmers, and laughing gulls. In addition, the islet is used at various times as a loafing area by white pelicans,    brown pelicans, and various other species of terns and gulls. Recent hurricanes and storms have eroded the    island to such an extent that no nesting has occurred since 1992. Public access to the refuge is restricted due    to its remoteness.',

The refuge supports about 200 species of migratory birds, including priority species such as the prothonotary warbler. This little cavity nester is a species of concern in other areas, but has plenty of habitat around the wooded waters of Mathews Brake. Refuge staff manage the water level in the brake to promote moist-soil plants and to sustain oak trees around the edges for migratory birds. Other habitat types include 422 acres of bottomland hardwoods and 186 acres of young hardwood plantations. Hunting and fishing are the most popular programs on the refuge.",

Where the swales dip below the water table, sub-irrigated meadows, marshes, and lakes have formed. In most cases, no stream systems exist between wetlands. Many lakes are maintained solely by underground water sources. The 45,849-acre Refuge is largely grasslands dotted with hundreds of permanent, semipermanent, and temporary wetlands.

The Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve encompasses approximately 115,000 acres in southeastern New Jersey, including a great variety of terrestrial, wetland and aquatic habitats within the Mullica River-Great Bay ecosystem. The Reserve is a concentrated patchwork of federal and state lands managed in partnership through a variety of agencies. With little more than 1% of the Reserve subjected to human development, this area is regarded as one of the least disturbed estuaries in the densely populated urban corridor of the Northeastern United States. Occurring within the unique New Jersey Pinelands forest ecosystem, on the coastal plain and the barrier islands of the coastal margin, the Mullica River-Great Bay estuary is of special ecological value. The high environmental quality of the habitats within the Cousteau Reserve are consistent with the objective of the Reserve system to preserve areas which retain a healthy ecosystem and provide the opportunity to serve the needs of long-term research and monitoring programs.

Many rare plants, including several orchids, occur on the refuge. A major purpose of the refuge is the protection of the secondary dunes, which have become scarce on Long Island due to development. Long-tailed ducks, white winged scoter, common loon and horned grebe spend winter off the refuge shore, while shorebirds, songbirds and raptors are a treat to visiting wildlife watchers during spring and fall. Merlin, Coopers hawk, kestrel, sharp-shinned hawk, and peregrine falcon soar over the dunes during migration. Ipswich sparrow, rough-legged hawk, and short eared owl spend winter at the refuge offering birders a cold-weather destination. In late spring and summer the beach hosts piping plover, and common and least terns (protected by the Endangered Species Act) as well as sandpiper and other shorebirds.

      'The US Army Corps of Engineers built the Mount Morris Dam in the late 1940s to reduce flooding on the lower Genesee River.  Today, the dam continues to provide flood protection along 67 miles of the Genesee River Valley from the village of Mount Morris to downtown Rochester where the river enters Lake Ontario.    The US Army Corps of Engineers proudly promotes stewardship of public lands and waters.  In fact, the 20 mile upstream section of the Genesee River is safe guarded by the Genesee River Protection Act of 1989, which allows the dam to hold back water only to prevent flooding. Typically, the Genesee flows freely through the dam without interference. However, when the dam is preventing flooding, the water backs up to fill Letchworth Canyon until it can be released at a rate that will not cause flooding downstream.     Mount Morris Dam and Recreation Area is a day use park that offers a beautiful setting overlooking Letchworth Canyon, known as the "Grand Canyon of the East".  Explore the Visitor Center to learn more about the dam or join us for a free ranger guided walking tour of the Mount Morris Dam.  Spend time outside on the park grounds to enjoy captivating overlooks, picnic shelters, and a playground.  This is a great place to hike, bike, or view wildlife.  During the winter, explore the trails on snowshoes or cross country skis.',

In 1994, the U.S. Department of Defense determined it longer needed the site. It was subsequently transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1999.        The refuge is 566 acres.  It is located in the valley below the Shawangunk Mountains near the Hamlet of Wallkill in the Town of Shawangunk, Ulster County, New York.  Visitors are rewarded with spectacular views of the Shawangunks as well as many species of grassland birds.        This is an unstaffed satellite of the Wallkill River NWR.  Call 973-702-7266 for more information.        Keeping this grassland and controlling the invasion of weeds, woody shrubs, and trees is the highest management priority for the refuge. Even though human created, this grassland is increasingly important for grassland-dependent migratory birds.          As part of its management strategy, the refuge strives to restore and expand the habitats of six species of declining migratory birds that currently or historically occupied the refuge.  Bobolink, Savannah sparrow, Grasshopper sparrow, Upland Sandpiper, Northern Harrier, and Short-eared Owl are the focus of refuge management.",

      "The Conscience Point National Wildlife Refuge was established July 20, 1971 as a land gift from Stanley Howard. The 60-acre refuge is located in the Town of North Sea on the north shore of Long Islands south fork. The refuge protects grasslands, oak-beech forest, shrub habitats, kettle holes, freshwater marsh and saltmarsh. The refuge grasslands are a habitat model for maritime grasslands, a disappearing habitat type on Long Island due to development. Maritime grasslands are native grasslands composed of little bluestem grass, switch grass, poverty grass, hairgrass, and Prickly pear cactus. Wildlife on the refuge is as diverse as its habitats.  Waterfowl are primarily black ducks and bufflehead. The grasslands are being managed and enlarged specifically to attract grassland dependent birds such as grasshopper sparrow, eastern meadowlark, savannah sparrow and bobolink. Due to its coastal location, the refuge is heavily used by migratory songbirds, shorebirds and raptors. The refuge also supports endangered and threatened species.",

      "Established December 27, 1954, through a donation by the Morton family, the 187-acre Elizabeth A. Morton National Wildlife Refuge boasts exceptionally diverse habitats including bay beach, a brackish pond, a freshwater pond, kettle holes, tidal flats, saltmarsh, freshwater marsh, shrub, grasslands, maritime oak forest, and red cedar.  The refuges diversity is not only critical to Long Island wildlife, but its picturesque quality is nothing short of an advertisement in a travel magazine! Habitats along the beach attract many species including nesting piping plovers, roseate terns, least terns, common terns, and shorebirds. The waters surrounding the refuge are considered critical habitat for juvenile Kemps Ridley sea turtles and are occasionally used by loggerhead sea turtles.  Waterfowl use of the refuge peaks during the colder months.  Long-tailed ducks, white winged scoter, goldeneye and black ducks will most likely be spotted during winter. Much of the refuge is situated on a peninsula surrounded by Noyack and Little Peconic Bays.  The north/south orientation of the peninsula makes the refuge important habitat for shorebirds, raptors and songbirds as they navigate the coastline during migration.",

      "Kaw Lake is located in north central Oklahoma, approximately 8 miles east of Ponca City, Oklahoma, on the Arkansas River. Project land extends northward into Kansas, ending near Arkansas City. The lake covers 17,000 surface acres and has 168 miles of shoreline at the normal elevation of 1010.00 feet above sea level. Ground breaking ceremonies were held in May 1966 and impoundment of the reservoir occurred in 1976. Construction on the recreation facilities concluded in July of 1980 with the completion of the Osage Cove Public Use Area.   There are nine public use areas and two lake access points located around the lake for visitors to enjoy. Campers can select from over 300 family campsites, many of which are equipped with water and electric hookups. Groups of all types enjoy four group camping areas, three of which are located at the Osage Cove Public Use Area and one located at the Sarge Creek Cove Area. Use of the group camping areas is by reservation only. Interested parties can contact the Kaw Lake Office for reservations. Ten boat launching ramps provide boaters with easy access to Kaw Lake. Once on the water, boaters can find two full service marinas located at McFadden Cove and Pioneer Park. Swimmers are invited to enjoy designated swimming areas at Pioneer Park and Sandy Park.   Kaw Lake and the Arkansas River have long been known for producing some of Oklahomas largest catfish. Kaw Lake also offers anglers excellent opportunities to catch crappie, sand (white) bass and walleye. Hunters skills are tested with excellent populations of whitetail deer, turkey, quail, rabbit and squirrel. During the fall waterfowl seasons Kaw Lake often attracts large numbers of migrating ducks and geese.   One of Kaw Lakes most popular winter attractions is the American Bald Eagle. Traditionally, Kaw Lake has one of the states largest populations of wintering bald eagles. Numerous sites around the lake offer visitors excellent opportunities to view our nations symbol. Peak viewing usually occurs shortly after the first of the year and lasts through January.   Hikers and horseback riders are attracted to the beautiful trails along Kaw Lakes eastern shore. The Eagle View Hiking Trail is approximately 12 miles long and runs between Osage Cove and Burbank Landing. The Five Fingers Equestrian Trail extends from Burbank Landing to the Sarge Creek Cove Public Use Area. Users should be aware that both trails are closed during Oklahomas deer rifle and primitive firearms seasons.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Kaw Lake invites you to visit this beautiful facility. We hope that you will make safety a priority with each and every visit. Whether you are on the water or in your car, please obey the rules and regulations that are in place to protect you and the resources at Kaw Lake. Please contact the Kaw Lake Office at 9400 Lake Road, Ponca City, Oklahoma, 74604, call us at 580-762-5611 or E-Mail us at od-fkk@swt02.swt.usace.army.mil if you would like further information about Kaw Lake.",

You can see these magnificent changes from one of our many Public Use Areas or from our Short Mountain Hiking Trail.   For young and old alike Kerr Lake has a variety of recreation for everyone, from swimming on our many beaches to camping ad picnicking in one of our five park areas. Our camping areas include facilities such as boat launching ramps, designated camps sites, picnic areas, drinking water, shower facilities and sanitary facilities.   Whether by power boat, sailboat or any type of craft, the broad expanse and depth of the water just above the dam and extending about 7 miles upstream, will satisfy the demand for any type of pleasure craft.   Robert S. Kerr Reservoir provides excellent opportunities for fishing and hunting. Principal species of fish in the lake include largemouth and striped bass, white crappie, channel and flathead catfish, walleye and various sunfish species.   Opportunities are equally as good for the hunting enthusiast. Principal species present at the project include white tailed deer, fox and gray squirrel, cottontail and swamp rabbit, raccoon, mink, opossum, bobwhite quail, mourning dove and several species of waterfowl.",

      'Recreation opportunities abound in the Lake Tenkiller area. Nestled in the Cookson Hills of eastern Oklahoma, this body of water is known as "Oklahomas Clear Water Wonderland" and its reputation is well deserved. The lake is well known by fisherman, pleasure boaters and scuba divers as the best place for water-based activities. Just the fact that there are 10 marinas and over 20 launching ramps here should tell you something. Camping is also big on Tenkiller with 14 campgrounds operated by the Corps, State of Oklahoma, and concessionaires. Types of camping range from primitive to full hookup and are pretty evenly spread out from one end of the lake to the other.   Another outdoor activity while in the lake area would be to hike one or more of the three nature trails. The trails vary in length from 1 1/4 miles to over 2 miles. Spectacular vistas, rock formations and many species of wildlife are just a few of the things to take in as you hike along.   Almost all project lands are open to public hunting except for parks and around the dam and control structures. Principal species hunted are whitetail deer, turkey, rabbit and squirrel. A map of public hunting areas is available from the project office and it is included in the public hunting atlas published by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. State laws apply on these lands so be familiar with the rules before you hunt or fish. Most of all, the Corps of Engineers at Tenkiller Ferry Lake wants you to have a safe and enjoyable visit. You, our customer, are important to us and we want you to come back and see us again.',

In tribute to his philosophy, the Leopold Wetland Management District is dedicated to preserving, restoring, and enhancing wildlife habitat in Wisconsin for the benefit of present and future generations. The district, established in 1993, manages over 10,600 acres of waterfowl production areas (WPAs) in 16 southeastern Wisconsin counties, covering some of the most important waterfowl areas of Wisconsin. The district also administers 45 conservation easements, totaling 3,000 acres, in 33 eastern Wisconsin counties. WPAs consist of wetland habitat surrounded by grassland and woodland communities. While WPAs are managed primarily for ducks and geese, they also provide habitat for a variety of other wildlife species such as non-game grassland birds, shorebirds, wading birds, mink, muskrat, wild turkey, and deer.",

      "Lying along the eastern edge of the tallgrass prairie in west-central Wisconsin, the St. Croix Wetland Management District encompasses a fascinating diversity of habitats.  Within the eight-county district, one can travel north through the high river bluffs of Pepin County, to the prairie potholes of St. Croix County, and then to the pine barrens of Burnett County. The district includes Barron, Burnett, Dunn, Washburn, Pierce, Pepin, Polk, and St. Croix counties.  The central portion of St. Croix County, the heart of the district, is known as the Star Prairie Pothole Grasslands.  These grasslands are ranked sixth out of 26 priority grassland landscapes in Wisconsin. The district manages relatively small tracts of prairie wetland and grassland habitats known as waterfowl production areas (WPAs).  WPAs are purchased using Federal Duck Stamp dollars within the historic prairie pothole portion of the district, including southern Polk, St. Croix and Dunn counties.  After purchase, prairie wetland and grassland habitats are restored and then managed for breeding waterfowl, other migratory birds, and indigenous wildlife. The districts 40 WPAs totaling 7,000 acres are administered by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Services National Wildlife Refuge System. In addition to managing WPAs, district staff provide assistance to private landowners who wish to manage their land to benefit wildlife. The St. Croix Wetland Management District is adjacent to the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropoitan Area of two million people.  St. Croix County is the second fastest growing county in Wisconsin and has the highest per capita income. This dynamic presents unique opportunities and challenges for prairie wetland habitat preservation, restoration and management.",

Welcome to     Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge!        This 6,200-acre refuge lies within the Mississippi flyway, along the Mississippi River in western Wisconsin. It is an isolated backwater, cut off from the Mississippi and Trempealeau rivers by dikes, providing needed resting and feeding areas for waterfowl and other birds.        The refuge is situated in a unique geological formation known as the driftless area.  Thousands of years ago,    glaciers surrounded but did not pass over the land.  Blown into mounds, sand and silt from melting glaciers     formed the rolling sand prairies of the refuge.        Wetlands are a prominent feature.  Before the railroads arrived and the locks and dams were built,    the lands within the refuge were part of the Mississippi River.  As such, these backwaters experienced floods and     droughts.  Today, using dikes and control structures, managers can mimic this natural cycle by lowering the water    to expose mudflats and allow plants to germinate.  Migratory waterfowl and marsh birds benefit.",

      "Whittlesey Creek National Wildlife Refuge is part of a large wetland complex on Lake Superior, near Ashland, Wisconsin. These coastal wetlands are a significant part of the wildlife habitat and aquatic resources of the south shore of Lake Superior. The refuge was established in 1999, and it is still being created.  Its purpose is to protect, restore, and manage coastal wetland and spring-fed stream habitat. Up to 540 acres of coastal wetland in the Whittlesey Creek watershed will be acquired, and up to 1,260 acres will be protected through conservation easements. Restoration of coaster brook trout, an anadromous fish native to Lake Superior, is one of the refuge goals. The refuge will also restore stream and wetland habitat to benefit other fish species and migratory birds. The refuge is located immediately north of the Northern Great Lakes Visitor Center, which is operated by the Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, Wisconsin State Historical Society, University of Wisconsin Extension Service, and Friends of the Center Alliance, Ltd. The Center serves as the headquarters and contact station for the refuge.",

      "Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge is, at 1.637 million acres, about the size of the state of Delaware. It sits atop the Arctic Circle, with approximately a third of the refuge above that meridian and two-thirds below. The refuge is a prime example of Alaskas boreal ecosystem, which is dominated by black and white spruce with some white birch and poplars. The regions typically short, hot summers give rise to numerous thunderstorms and lightning strikes. This results in a continuous cycle of burn and recovery.  Natural wildfires create diverse habitats with different plant species, and levels of maturity within each species.  The resulting mosaic of habitat types supports a variety of wildlife. The refuges migratory fish, chinook, chum and coho salmon, as well as sheefish, are creatures of extremes. Its Sheefish make the longest spawning journey of any of their species population on record, while Kanutis salmon travel more than 1000 miles up the Yukon before entering the Koyukuk River system to spawn. Refuge waters support twelve other fish species, including arctic grayling and northern pike. Protecting breeding habitat for migratory birds is central to the mission of Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Nearly 130 species of birds spend part or all of the year on refuge lands. With the loss of wetlands in regions outside of Alaska, the importance of Kanuti as a nesting area for birds is likely to increase. The refuges boreal forest is home to 37 species of mammals, including brown and black bears, several wolf packs, moose, wolverine, beavers, muskrats, marten and mink. Caribou from the Western Arctic and Ray Mountain herds occasionally winter on Kanuti, as well.",

Wooden posts along the trail show the mileage from the start at Eagle Summit to the trail�s end at Twelvemile Summit. Two  shelters provide refuge from storms, but hikers should come prepared for unpredictable, dramatic alpine weather.  Finding drinking water along the trail can become difficult later in the summer, when snowfields and small ponds dry up.

      "The Gulkana River watershed drains approximately 2,140 square miles of Southcentral Alaska. The river begins in the Alaska Range near Summit Lake and flows south into the Copper River, which eventually empties into the Gulf of Alaska between Cordova and Katalla. Several hundred lakes and ponds are scattered throughout the spruce-dominated forest of the Gulkana River watershed, providing abundant nesting areas for trumpeter swans and waterfowl.   Portions of the Gulkana River were designated for its wild character as part of the National Wild and Scenic River system. The BLM asks that all users do their part to help maintain the wild character of the Gulkana through low impact camping techniques.    Seasons and Climate    The Gulkana River running season generally begins in early to mid-June, depending on ice breakup and precipitation. Average annual precipitation is 11 inches of rain and 48 inches of snow. July is commonly the wettest month. Summer temperatures range from 35 F to occasional highs in the 80s. Be prepared for cold, wet weather at any time. By mid-September, shorter days and colder temperatures bring the river-running season to a quick end.    History and Prehistory    The initial seven-mile stretch of the Middle Fork of the Gulkana River is within the Tangle Lakes Archaeological District. This area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Several known prehistoric sites are located within the corridor. The Ahtna Indians were the earliest known humans to use the Gulkana River. Around 1910, miners used the West Fork and the Middle Fork routes to reach the Denali Mining District, about 80 air-miles to the west.  NOTE: Collection or disturbance of any historic or prehistoric remains is against the law.     Vegetation and Wildlife      Spruce-hardwood forest is the major vegetation type along the Gulkana River. You may see white and black spruce, birch, aspen and popular forests. The understory includes willow, alder, rose, dwarf birch, cranberry, blueberry, Labrador tea, dwarf dogwood, lichens and mosses.   Depending on location, you may see grizzly bear, black bear, moose, caribou, beaver, coyote, otter, bald eagles, kingfishers, and assorted waterfowl. There are more than 33 species of mammals and 59 species of birds known to live in the Gulkana River basin.    Fish    The Gulkana Rivers abundant fish makes it one of the most popular sportfishing rivers in Alaska. Its tributaries contain rainbow trout/steelhead, arctic grayling, king salmon (chinook), red salmon (sockeye), whitefish, longnose suckers, and lamprey. The surrounding lakes have good populations of lake trout, burbot and whitefish.   You can purchase an Alaska fishing license and view sportfishing regulations online at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game website or buy in person from license agents throughout the state, including stores in Glennallen, Delta Junction and Tok. Fishing is particularly heavy on weekends in June and July when the kings are running.",

Included among the thorny buckbrush and foothill pine is a rich variety of annual wildflowers, which put on a showy display every spring.  In the Red Hills buckbrush and other shrubs provide browse and seeds for small populations of mammals, including mule deer, jackrabbits, rodents. Coyotes, bobcats and fox can also be found in the Red Hills. Approximately 88 bird species have been observed in the Red Hills. Some common species include mourning dove, acorn woodpecker, ash-throated flycatcher, scrub jay, wrentit, plain titmouse, bushtit, Bewicks wren, and house finch. Valley quail and mourning doves are the major game birds in the Red Hills. An abundant insect population supports insectivorous birds including western kingbirds, ash- throated flycatcher, tree swallows, barn swallows, black phoebes, and others. Raptors include the red-tailed hawk, Coopers hawk, prairie falcon, and great horned owl. Fish-eating birds seen in the Red Hills include the belted kingfisher and great blue heron. Roadrunners can also be found.  Four sensitive species of animals are known from the Red Hills.

      "The BLM Merced River Recreation Management Area and Campgrounds are OPEN.  There are no seasonal road closures at this time  (posted Nov. 12, 2019).    The Merced River Recreation Management Area (RMA) is a very special place just downstream from Yosemite.  It is well known for excellent whitewater boating, wildflower viewing, camping, swimming, and recreational gold panning/prospecting.    Visitors will have plenty to do in the Merced River RMA during every season.  Springtime comes early to the Merced River Canyon and by March the wildflower season is well on its way lasting into May.  Easy access, un-damned flows, and excellent whitewater boating attract rafters and kayakers during the spring runoff (April through July).  Commercial rafting trips are available from BLM permitted outfitters.    The Merced River is a very popular swimming destination during the hot California foothill summers with some of the clearest swimming hole around.  Gold panning and prospecting have never fallen out of favor since the 1850’s when this canyon had a large mining population.  In autumn the crowds subside and the Merced River Recreation Area provides more solitude while still offering most of the appeal and activities as earlier in the year.  By winter, true solitude can be found.  The weather is usually quite warm and sunny between storms.  Daytime highs in the 60’s and overnight lows in the 30’s are common.   While some activities are best in specific seasons, there are many things to do all year long.  Bird watching is good throughout the area most of the year.  Fishing is popular for trout and bass along the entire river.  Biking along the gravel roads and trails is popular with families and experienced mountain bikers alike.  Hiking is great anytime of the year. The Merced River Trail continues on downstream from the end of the Briceburg River Road and brings hikers or bikers to the North Fork of the Merced and beyond.  The Burma Grade is another popular route to explore on foot, bike, or high-clearance automobile.  This scenic backroad climbs steeply out of the Merced Canyon and eventually leads to Greely Hill or Buck Meadows (Highway 120).     CAMPGROUNDS, TRAILHEADS, AND DAY-USE AREAS:  There are three (3) developed BLM campgrounds along the Merced River between Briceburg and Bagby. The campgrounds are accessed by crossing the suspension bridge just past the Briceburg Visitor Center and heading down river along the unpaved Briceburg River Road (old Yosemite Valley Railroad Grade).Please Note: Trailers over 18 feet and large RVs are not recommended crossing the suspension bridge.

      "The Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge stretches across 20.5 miles between Melbourne Beach and Wabasso Beach along Floridas east coast. The refuge was established in 1991 and was named after the late Dr. Archie Carr, Jr., in honor of his extraordinary contribution to sea turtle conservation. The Refuge is a direct result of Dr. Carr bringing attention to the worlds declining turtle populations due to over-exploitation and loss of safe habitat. The refuge was designated to protect habitat for what is the most significant area for loggerhead sea turtle nesting in the Western Hemisphere, and the most significant area for green turtle nesting in North America. This represents 25-35% of all loggerhead and green sea turtle nests in the US. It also serves as a minor nesting area for the leatherback turtle, which is one of the worlds largest and rarest sea turtles. The long stretches of quiet, undisturbed sandy beaches, with little or no artificial light, are essential to the reproductive success and survival of the 15,000 to 20,000 sea turtles nesting annually. The 248-acre refuge is also unique for its placement within a patchwork of protected lands and among properties that have already been developed. To help preserve this globally important nesting ground the Service has established a partnership with State and County governments and private conservation groups to acquire and manage this dune habitat. The primary management thrust is to provide long term protection of this habitat for sea turtles and other listed species as well as providing compatible public use. Collaboratively, this partnership, known as the Archie Carr Working Group has protected over 900 acres and continues to educate thousands of residents and visitors about the unique characteristics of the barrier island ecosystem.",

All of the Wilderness is in the state of Florida. In 1976 the J.N. "Ding" Darling Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. The northern portion of the 6,400-acre refuge is a mass of mangrove islands designated as J. N. "Ding" Darling Wilderness. The Wilderness encompasses 2,619 acres. Scenic Wildlife Drive provides access along the southern edge of the Wilderness, where you can expect summer temperatures in the 90s and winter temperatures in the 70s. Humidity is almost always high, and afternoon rain showers are common in the summer. Mosquitoes and no-see-ums can be abundant at times, especially in the summer. Other residents include alligators, raccoons, bobcats, river otters, and marsh rabbits. Creatures for whom the refuge was established include such migratory birds as ospreys, brown pelicans, moorhens, ducks, herons, egrets, anhingas, wood storks, and roseate spoonbills. Motorized boating is allowed in designated areas. Kayaking, canoeing, and sportfishing is allowed throughout the open water areas of the Wilderness. Public access is restricted in designated closed areas and bird rookeries. Jay Norwood "Ding" Darling, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, helped pioneer the conservation movement, serving as head of the U.S. Biological Survey (forerunner of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), creating the Federal Duck Stamp Program, starting the Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit Program, and providing strong support for the expansion and administration of the National Wildlife Refuge System. Today, more than half of the 12-mile subtropical barrier island called Sanibel Island has been protected and bears witness to the legacy of the conservation visionary J. N. "Ding" Darling, through the National Wildlife Refuge named in his honor and the private conservation foundation he inspired.',

All of the Wilderness is in the state of Florida. In 1972 the Cedar Keys Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. Twelve keys that have been earmarked as protected breeding grounds for colonial birds make up Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuge. These keys, low islands rising just above the sea, are in fact one of the largest nesting areas in north Florida. The four outermost islands have been designated as Wilderness: Seahorse Key, North Key, Snake Key, and Bird Key (also known as Deadmans Key). Most of the keys were used as fishing camps or villages by ancient cultures thousands of years ago. A prominent sandy ridge distinguishes Seahorse Key, recalling the islands past life as a huge sand dune (granted this was hundreds of thousands of years ago). The ridge crests at 52 feet above sea level, making it the highest point on Floridas Gulfcoast. The other keys barely make it to 20 feet above the waves. An upland forest of cabbage palm, red bay, live oak, and laurel oak covers the ridge, with an understory of saw palmetto, yaupon, wild olive, prickly pear, eastern red cedar, and Spanish bayonet. Salt marsh and estuarine waters dotted with mangrove dominate the lower elevations. The most abundant species are white ibis, great egret, double-crested cormorant, snowy egret, tricolored heron, brown pelican, and great blue heron. Reptiles are common as well, including a dense population of cottonmouth snakes. Due to the shortage of fresh water, however, mammals are scarce. Visitors may use the beaches year round for beachcombing and bird watching, except Seahorse Key. Seahorse Key and a 300 foot buffer zone around the island is closed to all entry from March 1 through June 30 to protect colonial nesting birds. Camping is not permitted on any of the refuge islands.",

In the language of the Seminole Indians, Chassahowitzka means "Hanging Pumpkin," although no one seems to remember just how this region earned that moniker. Regardless, Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge encompasses 30,500 acres of mangrove islands, saltwater bays, estuaries, and brackish marshes, fringed with an oak-cypress-cedar hardwood swamp on the eastern side. Except for a northeastern portion, the entire refuge is designated Wilderness. The Homosassa River runs through the northern Wilderness, while the Chassahowitzka River marks the uppermost boundary of the southern Wilderness.  Originally established for the benefit of waterfowl, the area now provides critical habitat to a diversity of wildlife, including endangered species such as the West Indian manatee and whooping crane. The tidal bays, rivers, and creeks of Chassahowitzka NWR provide summer habitat for the West Indian manatee. These gentle aquatic mammals consume 10 to 15 percent of their body weight each day. With some animals exceeding 1,000 pounds, the abundance growth of musk grass in Chassahowitzkas shallow bays provides an important food source for manatees. While manatees frequent the refuge most often during the summer months, whooping cranes can only be seen on the refuge during the winter months. An experimental migratory population of whooping cranes has been migrating to the refuge to winter in the saltmarsh since 2001.',

      'Sunkhaze Meadows National Wildlife Refuge is located in the Town of Milford, Penobscot County, Maine, approximately fourteen miles north of Bangor.  The refuge was established in 1988 to ensure the ecological integrity of the Sunkhaze Meadows peat bog and the continued availability of its wetland, stream, forest and wildlife resources to the citizens of the United States.  The purpose of acquisition, under the authority of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 was "... for the development, advancement, management, conservation, and protection of fish and wildlife resources ..." and "... for the benefit of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in performing its activities and services.  Such acceptance may be subject to the terms of any restrictive or affirmative covenant, or condition of servitude  . . . "  The Land and Water Conservation Fund was the source of funding for the purchase        The refuge protects the second-largest and most unique peatland in Maine.  It contains several raised bogs or domes, separated from each other by extensive areas of streamside meadows.  Sunkhaze Stream bisects the refuge along a northeast to southwest orientation and, with its six tributaries, creates a diversity of wetland communities.  The bog and stream wetlands, along with the adjacent uplands and associated transition zones, provide important habitat for many wildlife species.  The wetland complex consists primarily of wet meadows, shrub thickets, cedar swamps, extensive red and silver maple floodplain forests and open freshwater stream habitats, along with those plant communities associated with peatlands such as shrub heaths and cedar and spruce bogs.        Sunkhaze Meadows National Wildlife Refuge provides habitat for three plants, seven birds, two mollusks and three invertebrates listed as Endangered or Threatened by the State of Maine.        In the early 1990s, the Benton and Sandy Stream Divisions were added to the refuge under the auspices of the 1990 Farm Bill.  These small areas are respectively located in the towns of Benton and Unity, Maine.  Both are managed for grassland-nesting birds, some of which are rare in Maine.        Four conservation easements are also managed by Sunkhaze Meadows Refuge.  They are the Downing, Fortin, Miller, and Quayle Easements, totaling seven separate parcels of land.  Downing Easement lands are located in the towns of Corinth and Exeter.  Fortin Easement lands are located in Fairfield, while lands of the Miller and Quayle Easements are located in the towns of Starks and Patten, respectively.',

      "Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1966 in cooperation with the State of Maine to protect valuable salt marshes and estuaries for migratory birds.  Scattered along 50 miles of coastline in York and Cumberland counties, the refuge consists of ten divisions between Kittery and Cape Elizabeth.  It will contain approximately 7,600 acres when land acquisition is complete.        Our namesake, Rachel Carson, was a world-renowned marine biologist, author and environmentalist.  She served as an aquatic    biologist and Editor-in-Chief for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  During her tenure, she composed a series    of articles on Atlantic Coast wildlife refuges.          Ms. Carson was born in Pennsylvania in 1907.  Though the mystery of the sea and its creatures captivated her at an early age, the Maine coast particularly inspired her.  Beginning in 1952, she summered on Southport Island, where she studied its beach and tide pools to research The Edge of the Sea (1955).         Through tireless investigation for her greatest work, Silent Spring (1962), she linked the unrestrained use of post-World War II chemical pesticides with fearsome, biological consequences.  Overcoming industry and government pressure to abandon her research, she persevered.  Carson simply and convincingly explained the connections between humans and all creatures of the Earth.  She alerted generations to use chemicals with    utmost caution, warning that their improper use has dreadful effects on public health and the environment.          Rachel Carson died in 1964, a victim of cancer.  As fitting recognition of her tireless work, this refuge, first known as the Coastal Maine National Wildlife Refuge, was renamed in her honor on October 28, 1969 and formally dedicated June 27, 1970.",

Standing dead green ash trees are the main vegetation, with a lush understory of common elderberry, scattered red-osier dogwood, and an abundance of "weedy" plants.

      "Rydell National Wildlife Refuge is located in the Prairie Pothole Region of Northwestern Minnesota, between the flat Red River Valley Floodplain to the west and the rolling hardwood forest and lake regions to the east.          The refuge is located on the historic Glacial Lake Agassiz beach ridge transition zone, changing from northern tallgrass prairie/aspen parkland to eastern deciduous forest. Current ecological communities on the refuge consist of northern tallgrass prairie, prairie wetlands, maple-basswood forest, oak savannah, and aspen-ironwood-ash-birch regrowth. Sundew Bog, a rich fen area that sustains the carnivorous round-leafed sundew plant, as well as other rare indigenous plants, is the most unusual remnant plant community on the refuge.         The refuge visitor center and an extensive trail system allow for optimum wildlife observation and photography. The unique combination of habitats provides sanctuary for an impressive diversity of mammals, raptors, invertebrates and over 100 species of migratory waterfowl and songbirds that breed and migrate through the refuge each year.",

There are trails for hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, and motorized use. The trails vary in length and difficulty. Approximately 200 miles are completed of the 500-mile Ozark Trail, connecting from St. Louis to the Arkansas border. Plans are to connect the Missouri section with the Ozark Highlands Trail in Arkansas. The Forest has more than 350 miles of perennial streams, most suitable for floating with canoes, kayaks, rafts, and inner tubes. The Forest and Missouri Department of Conservation maintain river accesses on popular streams. Permitted outfitters provide services to the public at various locations throughout the forest.  There are more than 35 campgrounds and picnic areas usually located near a special attraction such as a spring, stream, lake, towering bluff or other scenic area. Campgrounds and picnic areas vary from a few table sites to developed campgrounds. There are no cabins available for rent on the forest at this time. The forest manages more than 78,000 acres as semi-primitive areas where the only access is by hiking, horseback, or mountain bike. Another 265,000 acres offer semi-primitive motorized recreation. These areas provide moderate to high opportunities for solitude. Hunting and fishing, with a valid Missouri Department of Conservation fishing license, are permitted in these areas. In addition, Mark Twain National Forest has seven Congressionally-designated Wilderness areas and 26,000 “special areas.” Special areas are managed for the protection of unusual environmental, recreation, cultural or historical resources, and for scientific or educational studies.",

      "The Mingo Wilderness now contains a total of 7,730 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Service. All of the Wilderness is in the state of Missouri. In 1976 the Mingo Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. Eighteen thousand years ago, the Mississippi River flowed through this area on its way to the Gulf of Mexico. Because of natural events, the river shifted east forming a biologically rich swampland comprised of bottomland hardwoods intermixed with cypress and tupelo. The former channel basin attracted Native Americans who utilized the bountiful natural resources. By the late 1800’s, settlers and loggers started draining the swamp while removing large tracts of old-growth forest. In 1944, Congress authorized the purchase of the remnant forest lands to create the 21,592 acre Mingo National Wildlife Refuge. Today, Mingo Wilderness is a large fragment of this refuge. The wilderness provides critical food and shelter for bald eagles and migratory waterfowl along the Mississippi Flyway. Giant cypress dominates the wilderness swamp offering nesting platforms for eagles and other birds. Otters and beaver, turkey and amphibians are frequent sightings for visitors. Predator-proof nesting boxes, used commonly by the evasive wood ducks, dot the refuge. The western one-third of the refuge offers a wilderness setting with diverse habitat and abundant wildlife, an area highlighted with gentle rolling hills of the Ozark Plateau nestled beside Monopoly Marsh with intersecting streams and rich swamplands. Meandering underneath a canvas of cypress and mixed hardwoods, the Stanley Creek and Mingo River flows gently out of the Mingo Wilderness into the remainder of the Refuge--offering many miles of ditches for easy canoe access.",

Like pearls on a string, these acres are spread out as individual units along the Missouri River between Kansas City and St. Louis. These pearls of habitat benefit floodplain-dependent fish and wildlife species. The Big Muddy Refuge is planning to grow to 60,000 acres by buying land from willing sellers who want to see their properties set aside for the benefit of wildlife and the enjoyment of all. The pre-development Missouri River as documented by Lewis and Clark was considerably different from todays river.  The historic Missouri was a broad, slow-moving, shallow river with braided channels. To put it in perspective, Lewis and Clark didnt float up the Missouri River, they pulled and poled their boats up. These past river conditions created a haven for wildlife, which included vast floodplain forests of giant trees, marshes, and even wet prairies.  Todays river is channelized.  It is deeper and faster, and controlled by levees, dikes, and other containment structures.  These controls make the river more navigable and the surrounding floodplain ideal for agriculture.The Big Muddy Refuge is allowing the Missouri River to be a river again.  In locations where we have acquired enough land and are not affecting preferred conditions of adjacent private lands, we are allowing the river to enter its floodplain.  This occurs during minor flood events.  We have created side channels, cut down levees, and allowed the floodplain vegetation to return. Currently, in many places the refuge is an impenetrable thicket of young trees and vegetation, but, as the trees grow and the refuge matures, its appearance will change.  The process may take decades or even centuries, but we are committed to the future benefit of fish and wildlife resources in the Missouri River floodplain.  Come grow with us.",

      "Grimes Point is an archaeological site which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. During the Pleistocene Epoch, this area and most of northwestern Nevada, was covered by ancient Lake Lahontan. Over the last 10,000 years, the level of ancient Lake Lahontan fluctuated widely, at times drying up completely. When above water, the Grimes Point area would have been marshland with a wide variety of wetland plants and animals available for use by prehistoric populations. Grimes Point was first visited by Native Americans perhaps 8,000 years ago or more. Grimes Point is a field of basalt boulders that are covered with a glossy black patina, commonly called desert varnish. Many of the boulders are covered with pecked or carved rock art called petroglyphs. The antiquity of many of the petroglyphs can be evidenced by how varnish has completely repatinated the carved surfaces. Visitors today can view examples of petroglyphs along a 1/4 mile, self-guided interpretive trail. The trail was originally constructed by the Youth Conservation Corps and named Nevadas first National Recreation Trail in 1978.  Handicapped accessible restrooms and picnic facilities are available at this popular stop on U.S. Highway 50. Contact the BLM Carson City District Office at (775) 885-6000 for more information or to arrange for a guided tour of the site for school or other large groups. Guided public tours are also available at nearby Hidden Cave on the second and fourth Saturday of each month. Check out the Churchill County Museum in Fallon and the Nevada State Museum in Carson City for additional displays about prehistoric Nevada and Grimes Point and Hidden Cave. Please stay on the trail and help ensure this special place remains for future generations by respectfully viewing the petroglyphs. Take nothing but photographs. Please do not touch, chalk, create rubbings of the petroglyphs, or damage them in any way.  Hidden Cave is an archaeological site which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1972, as part of Grimes Point. The cave itself was formed around 21,000 years ago by the waves of rising Pleistocene Lake Lahontan. In the mid-1920s, the cave was found by four school boys, the first 20th century humans to do so. The cave has been excavated by archaeologists three times: once in 1940, again in 1951, and finally a large excavation in 1979-1980 by the American Museum of Natural History. A high proportion of the artifacts found in Hidden Cave were unbroken and arranged in concentrations. That led to the conclusion that 3,500 to 3,800 years ago people used the cave more as a cache (a place to store objects for later) than for habitation.  The BLM gives free public tours of Hidden Cave on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month with the exception of any three day weekend where the Friday or Monday is a federally recognized holiday, like Memorial Day, Thanksgiving, and Labor Day. The tours begin at the Churchill County Museum in Fallon, at 9:30 a.m. with a special video showing, and then the group caravans out to Hidden Cave and walks up the trail to the cave entrance. The tours end by 12:00 p.m. Additionally, tours for private groups can be arranged to be given at other times by docents from the Churchill County Museum. If you plan to visit Hidden Cave, please wear sturdy walking shoes, bring water, and dress appropriately for the weather (it can change in a hurry during every season). Hidden Cave can only be accessed through taking a scheduled tour. The site is on a 1/2 mile interpretive loop trail that is not handicapped accessible. The tour may not be suitable for very young children because of its length and the climb up the hill.",

Here you may find the ruby red semi-precious gems in the rocky volcanic outcrops. Garnets can be found either through careful rock breaking or searching the surface and drainages for the dark colored stones. The garnets will usually occur as single crystals attached to small cavities in the rhyolite rock, though they may weather out of the rock, and wash downhill. Bring a rock hammer or just search the ground to locate these crystals. Although most of the garnets found here are not of perfect gem quality, most people go home happy with their finds. Garnet Hill is also an excellent location to view the excavations of the massive open pit copper mines near Ruth, Nevada. Things to note: There are four picnic sites with grills and a handicap accessible restroom available. A group barbeque area is also available. There are two informal areas for tents or small campers.

      'Caballo Lake State Park is located in the dramatic landscape of the northern Chihuahuan desert, it has become an oasis in an otherwise arid environment.  Caballo Lake is named for the Caballo Mountains that border the lake to the northeast, east, and southeast, in which wild horses roamed; Caballo means "horse" in Spanish. Caballo Lake is a reservoir on the Rio Grande in southern New Mexico. Caballo Lake was built in the 1930s as part of the Depression-era New Deal Program.  In 1964 Caballo Lake became a state park. The area surrounding Caballo Lake is rich in both natural and cultural history. Desert mountain ranges and millions of years of geologic history surround the lake, situated in the southern Rio Grande valley. The sedimentary layers of earth surrounding the lake hold tangible evidence of ancient life in the form of plant fossils and faunal remains.  Evidence for people living in the area goes back thousands of years. Caballo Lake State park offers a visitor center, camping, allows horseback riding, showers, group shelters, electric hook ups, restrooms, dump stations, boating/boat ramps, fishing, playground, trails, and R.V. pull through sites.  Caballo Lake State Park is open all year, with the exception of those areas which are seasonally closed, or those areas or facilities which are closed temporarily for maintenance or safety purposes. The office is generally open from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily. Make a reservation on the New Mexico State Parks reservation website.',

      "The Organ Mountains WSA is located in south-central New Mexico on the eastern edge of Las Cruces.  The Organ Mountains range from 4,600 to just over 9,000 feet, and are so named because of the steep, needle-like spires that resemble the pipes of an organ.  Alligator juniper, gray oak, mountain mahogany and sotol are the dominant plant species here, but in the upper elevations stands of ponderosa pine may be found.  Seasonal springs and streams occur in canyon bottoms, with a few perennial springs that support riparian habitats.  Wildlife includes desert mule deer, mountain lion, a variety of song birds, and a race of the Colorado chipmunk.  The WSA includes the Baylor Pass National Recreation Trail.  Per the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act which became law on March 12, 2019, this web page is currently being updated.

      "The Cape Romain Wilderness now contains a total of 29,000 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Services Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge. All of the Wilderness is in the state of South Carolina. In 1975 the Cape Romain Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. For 22 miles, the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge stretches wild and free along the coastline of South Carolina, protecting sanctuaries of open water, sandy beaches, saltwater marshes, and tens of thousands of water-loving birds. No other place on the Atlantic coast attracts as many oystercatchers during winter. Waiting patiently until an oyster opens up, these splendid black and white birds strike suddenly, using their long red beaks to rip at the oysters muscle. Here in summer youll find thousands of terns and brown pelicans, and black skimmers flying with their black and red bills gaping to skim food from the surface of the ocean and estuaries. Hundreds of herons and egrets pace on long legs looking for food, and the beaches stir under the feet of godwits, whimbrels, and dowitchers. In the marshes, the clapper rails, sometimes more than 25,000 of them, fill the air with their strange clattering. Colorful songbirds migrate through in spring, joining year-round residents such as flickers and yellow-throated warblers. Loggerhead sea turtles lay more eggs in these beaches than anywhere else along South Carolinas coast. Dont be surprised if you miss them, since they most often choose the night, when the refuge is closed, to drag their great broad backs from the ocean. Two historic lighthouses, built in 1827 and 1857, stand as sentinels on Lighthouse Island. No longer operational, they serve as daytime landmarks for recreational boaters. Four public tours are offered annually to Lighthouse Island. Sea kayaking is the best way to see Cape Romain. Overnight camping and campfires are prohibited. Most of the refuge has been designated Wilderness.",

      "Carolina Sandhills NWR was established in 1939 as a federal refuge for indigenous wildlife and game management demonstration project.  The South Carolina State Commission of Forestry also conducted timber production and harvesting as long as these activities conformed to good game management and forestry practices.  Over the years, management objectives have since been added and modified under other authorities.  The 45,348-acre refuge now serves as a demonstration site for land management practices, which preserve and enhance the longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem. Carolina Sandhills NWR is situated along the fall line separating the Atlantic Coastal Plain and the Piedmont Plateau in what is known as the Sandhills Region of South Carolina.  Due to its location, the refuge is home to a variety of plants, animals, and habitat types characteristic of both the coastal plain and Piedmont Plateau. Rolling sandhills and deep sandy soils found here are remnants of an ancient coastal shoreline of what is now known as the Atlantic Ocean. The refuge supports approximately 190 species of birds, 42 species of mammals, 41 species of reptiles, 25 species of amphibians, and innumerable species of plants.  Among this diverse group of fauna and flora are several species that are listed as threatened or endangered.  These include the Swainsons warbler, red-cockaded woodpecker, pine barrens treefrog, white wicky, Wells pixie moss, and the sweet pitcher plant.  Thirty man-made lakes & ponds & over 1,200 acres of fallow fields, forest openings, & cultivated fields contribute to the diverse habitat found here.  The refuge supports an estimated 125 clusters of the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker, the largest population in the National Wildlife Refuge System.",

Fish species include walleye, bass, northern pike, perch, bluegill, and crappie.Because the reservoir is located on the southeastern edge of the Black Hills and is the only large body of water in an isolated area of arid southwestern South Dakota, it is attractive to migrating waterbirds that follow the eastern edge of the Black Hills.  The lake also provides habitat for migrant passerine species that travel along the Cheyenne River on their twice-yearly flights to and from the north and the west.  The best birding area is along the undeveloped western side.The area is open year-round and an entrance fee is required year-round.

      "Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge is located in southeastern Virginia and was established in 1938 to provide habitat for migrating and wintering waterfowl. The Refuge contains more than 9,200 acres, situated in and around Back Bay, in the southeastern corner of the City of Virginia Beach. Because of its unique geographic location along the Atlantic Coast which provides overlapping ranges for both northern and southern species, biodiversity is high. Habitats include barrier island beach and dunes, shrub-scrub, woodlands, farm land and freshwater marsh. Since 1939, 4,600 acres of Back Bay waters, surrounding the original Refuge lands, have been closed to migratory bird hunting by Presidential Proclamation. Today, the Refuge continues to be an important link in the chain of national wildlife refuges along the Atlantic Flyway. More than 300 species of birds have been observed at the Refuge. During the fall and winter months, large flocks of waterfowl use the Bay and freshwater impoundments. The snow and Canada goose, tundra swan, and many duck species are abundant. Migrating songbirds and shorebirds arrive at the Refuge each spring and fall. Brightly colored warblers dot shrub and woodland areas while shorebirds search for food in shallow waters. Habitats are also used by a wide assortment of other wildlife, including such threatened and endangered species as the loggerhead sea turtle.",

      "Chincoteague NWR, located primarily on the Virginia side of Assateague Island, consists of more than 14,000 acres of beach, dunes, marsh, and maritime forest. Chincoteague NWR, originally established in 1943 to provide habitat for migratory birds (with an emphasis on conserving greater snow geese), today provides habitat for waterfowl, wading birds, shorebirds, and song birds, as well as other species of wildlife and plants. Refuge staff manage this barrier island habitat to allow many species of wildlife to coexist, each establishing their own place in the environment. In fact, more than 320 species of birds are known to occur on the refuge. The refuge has been designated a Globally Important Bird Area, is part of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network and designated as one of the top ten birding Hotspots by the National Audubon Society. Refuge management programs restore threatened and endangered species such as the Delmarva Peninsula fox squirrel, the bald eagle and the piping plover. More than 2,600 acres of man-mademarshes, or moist soil management units, are managed for wintering waterfowl and shorebirds during migration. Unique residents of the island, the famous Chincoteague ponies, are housed in two areas on the refuge through a special agreement with the ponies owners, the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. With approximately 1.4 million visits a year, Chincoteague NWR is one of the most visited refuges in the nation. Chincoteague NWR provides visitors with extraordinary educational and recreational opportunities. In addition, a special partnership exists with the National Park Service which allows Assateague Island National Seashore to administer public activities on a five-mile portion of the refuge beach. The new Herbert H. Bateman Educational and Administrative Center offers educational exhibits, an auditorium and wet laboratory/classroom for visiting groups.",
