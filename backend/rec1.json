      "description": "The 1,200-acre Black River Recreation Area is managed to provide low-impact recreation and environmental education opportunities while maintaining a healthy river system and riparian habitat. This river corridor acts as a transition zone between the limestone foothills of the Guadalupe Escarpment and the southern gypsum soils to the east. Several spring-fed pools within the area comprise the headwaters of the Black River. The area includes a series of deep, elongated pools interconnected by a shallow, narrow stream. The Black River, an oasis in the Chihuahuan Desert, is home to rare species of plants, fish and reptiles in and around the river. During migration seasons, the area teems with birds, including waterfowl, shorebirds and songbirds. Bird populations in this small area fluctuate daily and seasonally. Visitors may observe green-backed herons, orchard orioles, yellow-billed cuckoos, and roadrunners. Lush desert vegetation and clear pools of water provide excellent opportunities for viewing wildlife. The recreation area's most frequently visited site is the Cottonwood Day Use Area, which includes a wildlife viewing platform, picnic tables, and a toilet. The parking area is approximately 500 feet from the water's edge.<br><br>Facilities include a restroom and picnic tables. Drinking water is not available.",

The reservoir has approximately  4,407 water surface acres, 4,546 land acres and 42 miles of shoreline. Recreation on this reservoir is managed by the SD Department of Game, Fish and Parks for the Bureau of Reclamation and includes campgrounds, boat ramps, fishing pier and a marina.  Fish species include walleye, bass, northern pike, perch, bluegill, and crappie.Because the reservoir is located on the southeastern edge of the Black Hills and is the only large body of water in an isolated area of arid southwestern South Dakota, it is attractive to migrating waterbirds that follow the eastern edge of the Black Hills.  The lake also provides habitat for migrant passerine species that travel along the Cheyenne River on their twice-yearly flights to and from the north and the west.  The best birding area is along the undeveloped western side.The area is open year-round and an entrance fee is required year-round.
