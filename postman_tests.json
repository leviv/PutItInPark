There is no fee for hiking the Portal Trail, however please leave the place nicer than when you arrived by picking up any little you may find and by staying precisely on the trail provided.  This trail sees a lot of use and needs some help from you to stay nice!  Thank you!

Depending on water levels, rapids on this section range from Class I to Class III. No permits are required for private trips.  There are a number of commercial outfitters who have permits from the Moab BLM Field Office to offer guided trips on this section of the river.   State of Utah Boating Law requires all boaters to wear life vests.  Current streamflow conditions are available on the U.S Geological Survey website.

Special regulations apply for boaters wishing to camp along the \\\"Daily\\\" section. Overnight camping on river right (facing downstream) is allowed only in designated sites between Dewey Bridge and Salt Wash (the boundary of Arches National Park). On river left, people must camp in BLM developed campgrounds (dispersed camping is not allowed on this side of the river in order to protect resources).  Here is a map to help plan your activities along the \\\"Moab Daily\\\". For those wanting a longer trip, the 7.5 mile Dewey Bridge to Hittle Bottom stretch of the Colorado River offers flat water and great views.

It contains a mosaic of habitat types including tropical hardwood hammock, mangrove forest, and salt marsh.  These habitats are critical for hundreds of plants and animals including six federally-listed species.Crocodile Lake NWR is unusual in that not all of the critical habitat areas are in a pristine, undisturbed condition.  A large portion of the refuge was going to be a residential development complete with canals for boating access.  The dredge-spoil from the canal system was piled up in berms on the banks of the canals and became an important nesting area for the federally-listed American crocodile.  American crocodiles are fairly wide-spread throughout the tropics, however, in the U.S. crocodiles are only found in south Florida and the Keys. The refuge protects one of the largest remaining tracts of tropical hardwood hammock which is a globally threatened habitat type.  These diverse forests are home to hundreds of plants and animals including the federally-listed Key Largo woodrat, Key Largo cotton mouse, Schaus swallowtail butterfly, Stock Island tree snail, and Eastern indigo snake.

The site was excavated by Brigham Young University's Office of Public Archaeology, in cooperation with the BLM, from 1991 to 1994. Recovered artifacts are currently stored at BYU's Museum of People and Cultures in Provo, Utah. After the excavations, the site was backfilled (reburied with the dirt that was removed during excavation), a necessary step in protecting the cultural features that remain. As a result, the foundations of the village can no longer be seen on the surface. The walls visible today are modern walls, built in 2002. Artifacts found on the ground may be observed, but not removed, from the site. Brochures and an information kiosk are located at the parking area.

This creates open water (200 acres) and shallow mud flat areas interspersed with vegetation, which provide suitable resting, feeding, and nesting habitat for endangered water birds. During certain times of the year, the refuge supports at least half of the Hawaiian stilt population. The pond also supports a diverse assemblage of migratory birds from late summer (August) to early spring (April). It is one of the most important areas in the state for wintering migratory waterfowl. Migratory shorebirds also congregate here to take advantage of the food resources along the water's edge. As water recedes, fish are crowded into the remaining water, making them easy prey for 'auku'u (black-crowned night herons). Approximately 2,700 people visit the refuge each year to engage in various wildlife-oriented activities, including bird watching, photography, environmental education, habitat restoration projects that involve removal of exotic species, and outplanting with Hawaii's native vegetation.\",\n        \"imglink\": \"https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg\",\n        \"lat\": 20.7949134,\n        \"location\": \"Hawaii\",\n        \"lon\": -156.46632,\n        \"natpark\": \"Haleakala\",\n        \"num_activities\": 2,\n        \"par_org_id\": 127,\n        \"rec_id\": 1449,\n        \"rec_name\": \"Kealia-Pond-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n        \"reservable\": true,\n        \"stay_limit\": true\n    },\n    {\n        \"activities\": \"CAMPING,HIKING,SWIMMING\",\n        \"description\": \"This special place vibrates with stories of ancient and modern Hawaiian culture and protects the bond between the land and its people.

The Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness is bordered by the Cottonwood Forest Wilderness to the north.The approximately 11,700 acre Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness is within the newly-designated Red Cliffs National Conservation Area and shares a common boundary with the Cottonwood Forest Wilderness, located on the Dixie National Forest. Here, massive blocks of Jurassic age Navajo Sandstone have been eroded by wind and water, leaving rounded domes and numerous small canyons. The resulting landscape is both austere and intimate, affording outstanding opportunities for solitude and natural quiet, just minutes away from the major population centers of Washington County. Convenient trail access makes this wilderness a popular choice for hikers and equestrians. Visit the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area web page for more information about trails in the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness.  Although it is at the western edge of the Colorado Plateau, the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness supports plant and animals species that typify the arid Mojave Desert. Pockets of desert shrubs cover the sand dunes and rocky outcrops of this wilderness. Mojave Desert species, such as Utah agave, banana yucca, scrub oak , and single-leaf ash, are found in the lowlands and line the dry washes. At higher elevations, pinyon pine and Utah juniper dot the rocky slopes of the wilderness area. Mule deer, mountain lion, bobcat, and kit fox live here, as they do farther east on the Colorado Plateau. Mojave Desert species, including the federally-listed threatened Mojave Desert tortoise and the Gila monster and chuckwalla reptiles are also residents of the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness. Golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, and the western screen owl circle the craggy canyons of this wilderness area, searching for prey.

Kemple was an experienced prospector, and in 1868 he found a mineralized sandstone float (an ore unattached to the bedrock) that assayed very high in silver, but he had a hard time pinpointing its source. He returned in 1870, and discovered silver in the White Reef, at the Southern base of Pine Valley Mountain. But because the silver was in sandstone, which at the time was considered impossible, assayers were skeptical of his findings, which slowed the process for locating the source of his supplies. In 1874, John Kemple took the lead in organizing a new mining district called the Harrisburg Mining District, and Orson B. Adams was elected president. The first claim recorded within this district, was only about 300 hundred yards southwest from the Orson Adams House and was named Pride of the West Ledge and Kemple Company. Two years later, by early 1876, a surge of silver fever took off, and miners, along with supporting industries, flowed into the area.With the closest railroad a 100 miles away in Milford, on-site transformation of silver ore into bullion was crucial. The nearest mills were more than 300 miles away, so it was decided to build mills near the mines, process the ore, and then ship finished bullion to the railroad by wagon. Three of the five mills were built in Silver Reef, with one in Leeds and the other on the Virgin River, named Stormont Mill. Mines that would not pay before the mills came were now considered valuable property. During 1876, Silver Reef was one of the largest towns in Washington County, with about 1,500 residents. A development boom took place along mile-long Main Street, including the construction of 6 saloons, 9 grocery stores, 2 dance halls, a brewery, a billiard hall, the Wells Fargo Express Office, a jail, and a church, amongst many others. St. John Catholic Church was Southern Utahâ€™s first established Catholic congregation, founded in 1879, which housed the townâ€™s hospital in a rear wing. Only remnants of the church can still be seen. Town advocates wanted Silver Reef to become the county seat, but the more conservative citizens of neighboring towns, established by members of the LDS church, were against it.  As a typical boomtown, Silver Reef grew as quickly as it dwindled down. Reduced operations continued through 1909, after which mining completely stopped, and livestock owners took their place. When the town went extinct, neighboring town residents burrowed the leftover buildings and took the materials for their own use.\",\n        \"imglink\": \"https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg\",\n        \"lat\": 37.252778,\n        \"location\": \"Utah\",\n        \"lon\": -113.367778,\n        \"natpark\": \"Zion\",\n        \"num_activities\": 1,\n        \"par_org_id\": 126,\n        \"rec_id\": 16459,\n        \"rec_name\": \"Silver-Reef-Mining-District\",\n        \"reservable\": true,\n        \"stay_limit\": true\n    },\n    {\n        \"activities\": \"BIKING,HIKING,DAY-USE-AREA\",\n        \"description\": \"\",\n        \"imglink\": \"https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg\",\n        \"lat\": 37.626096,\n        \"location\": \"Utah\",\n        \"lon\": -113.07442,\n        \"natpark\": \"Zion\",\n        \"num_activities\": 3,\n        \"par_org_id\": 126,\n        \"rec_id\": 16694,\n        \"rec_name\": \"Iron-Hills-Trail-System\",\n        \"reservable\": true,\n        \"stay_limit\": true\n    },\n    {\n        \"activities\": \"WILDERNESS\",\n        \"description\": \"<br>The Beartrap Canyon Wilderness now contains a total of 40 acres and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management.

Also, the Park currently maintains a research area immediately downstream of the WSA that is closed to backcountry use. The northern half of Parunuweap is heavily wooded with pinyon and juniper with a jeep trail leading down into the canyon. This route should only be taken by people experienced in driving on rough mountain roads. The main landmarks in and directly south of the southern portion of the WSA are Harris Mountain and Elephant Butte. Again, springs and plant life concentrate animals in the area. Mule deer are common, and with the mule deer come predatory mountain lions. Many kinds of hawks, eagles and other birds can also be seen in the area. Beware, however, since rattlesnakes are also common here. Special Features: A major historical feature is the Elephant Gap or Foote Ranch Road, believed to follow the pioneer route between Pipe Spring, Arizona, and Long Valley, Utah. About 4.5 miles of this route are cherry-stemmed from the WSA and 4 miles are considered to be a way within the WSA.   The state sensitive bald eagle occasionally roosts in the WSA in the winter.   The peregrine falcon may nest within the WSA.   The golden eagle may also sometimes inhabit or nest in the WSA.   Other state sensitive or USFWS candidate or threatened animal species that may inhabit the WSA include ferruginous hawk, Mexican spotted owl, western yellow-billed cuckoo, and Bell's vireo.

In this wilderness, an 8-by-10 mile block of Navajo Sandstone, bounded by 2,000-foot-high cliffs, has been sculpted by wind and water over time into a landscape of soaring cliff walls, natural arches, and slot canyons.  On the highest plateaus, stands of ponderosa pine are surrounded by cream-colored slickrock. Pinyon pine, Utah juniper, scrub oak, and sagebrush cover the mountain slopes, at lower elevations.  Seeps in the canyon walls provide water for hanging gardens of maidenhair fern, monkeyflower, and columbine. Hawks, falcons, and golden eagles nest along the sandstone walls, while ringtailed cats, deer, cougar, and black bear live on the plateaus and in the canyon bottoms. This wilderness provides opportunities for primitive recreational activities, including hiking, equestrian trail riding, canyoneering, and camping. Several routes exist on the southern end of the wilderness providing access to higher elevations by way of steep canyons.

At a top elevation of 7,500 feet, both the mesa top and canyon bottom sustains Utah juniper and ponderosa and pinyon pine trees. Despite its small size, but because of its proximity to adjacent wilderness and other relatively undisturbed lands, a wide variety of wildlife lives here.

It is common to find habitation from these periods along water sources, in this case Quail Creek, where farming of maize and other crops was possible. One or two families lived together in pithouses, and later in multi-roomed surface pueblos. The families at this site were primarily sedentary farmers, cultivating small fields along the creek, but would also gather native plants and hunt. After 1200 A.D. the Ancestral Puebloans abandoned this site, possibly due to prolonged drought periods and climate change.BLM archaeologists excavated this site between 1977 and 1979, assisted by Youth Adult Conservation Corps youth crews.

Singletrack trail. 2.53 miles in length. Difficulty: Extremely difficult. From the trailhead, the trail immediately drops down a steep, rugged slope and careens toward the cliff edge on your right.  Follow the narrow, winding track southeast as it traverses the crumbling layers of sandstone, siltstone and mudstone below the mesa rim. Expect a steep, rocky descent along the entire trail, with sharp turns, sudden drop-offs and precipitous exposure. Keep in mind that entire sections of the trail may be washed out in places due to its location on a steep, eroded slope. The trail becomes braided in several sections, allowing users to choose one of several interconnected paths on their descent.If you have time to look up, youâ€™ll be rewarded with dramatic vistas of colorful badlands in the foreground, Gooseberry Mesa to the south, the craggy peaks of Canaan Mountain Wilderness to the southeast and the majestic West Temple of Zion National Park to the east.While keeping your eyes on the trail, you will experience a speedy ride-through tour of local geology. The trail begins in the Chinle Formation of the Upper Triassic Age atop the mesa then descends quickly through the Moenkopi layer of the Lower Triassic, a blur of red sandstone under your tires.  Soon after, you are plummeting through talus from the Holocene to upper Pleistocene Age before revisiting the Moenkopi Formation near the bottom of the escarpment.Once the trail drops to rolling lowlands and levels out, find your way back to SR 9 near Virgin by following the well-traveled dirt road south.   Note: This trail should only be considered by expert mountain bicyclists.

The WSA is 4,433 acres and measures approximately 6 miles from north to south and 3 miles from east to west. Private and state land surrounds most of the WSA with the state land nearly bisecting the study area. The southern boundary adjoins Zion National Park. All land within the WSA is managed by the BLM Cedar City Field Office. Spring Creek Canyon WSA includes a portion of the Hurricane Cliffs, an awesome west facing escarpment that extends from north of Cedar City into northwestern Arizona. Two major canyons, Kanarra Falls and Spring Creek Canyon, bisect the WSA with elevations ranging from 5,600 feet at the base of the cliffs to almost 7,900 feet on the ridge tops. Vegetation consists primarily of juniper, scrub oak, shrubs, and grasses; however, along the riparian zone, sedges, rushes, cottonwoods, and willows are prevalent. The area provides habitat for various birds of prey such as the bald eagle and peregrine falcon as well as 13 species of animals and 4 plant species that are considered sensitive.  The majority of the WSA is rated outstanding for scenic quality due to the stunning, narrow red rock canyons that offer spectacular hiking along the streambeds. In particular, hiking in Kanarra Canyon involves traveling (and sometimes wading) along Kanarra Creek and climbing up and over several beautiful waterfalls. Due to its immense beauty and unique hiking opportunities, this area sees a large number of visitors every year.\",\n        \"imglink\": \"https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg\",\n        \"lat\": 37.53691156,\n        \"location\": \"Utah\",\n        \"lon\": -113.1526672,\n        \"natpark\": \"Zion\",\n        \"num_activities\": 5,\n        \"par_org_id\": 126,\n        \"rec_id\": 16331,\n        \"rec_name\": \"Spring-Creek-Canyon\",\n        \"reservable\": true,\n        \"stay_limit\": true\n    },\n    {\n        \"activities\": \"WILDERNESS\",\n        \"description\": \"<br>This wilderness area is in Arizona (contiguous to the 44,531 acre Canaan Mountain Wilderness in Utah designated in 2009).

Adams House    The St. George Field Office has completed rehabilitation of a mid-19th century Mormon pioneer residence for adaptive re-use.  This small sandstone masonry house was built in 1863 for the Orson B. Adams family, in the now abandoned Mormon agricultural settlement of Harrisburg, located approximately 15 miles north of St. George.   Critical to the successful completion of the rehabilitation project were partnerships with Washington County, the Utah Heritage Foundation, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation; technical assistance from the Utah State Historic Preservation Office; and volunteer labor during several phases of the project.  The Adams house is open sporadically for public visitation with the assistance of volunteer docents.      In 2004, Washington County, Utah State University (USU), and the Utah Chapter-American Society of Landscape Architects worked with BLM to create a conceptual plan for public recreation use of the 215 acres that surround the Adams house.  Quail Creek flows through the tract, creating a lush riparian area with tall cottonwood trees and willows. Other historic Harrisburg structures, terraced gardens, an orchard, fields outlined by native rock walls, irrigation ditches, and wagon roads are preserved on the property.  Students and faculty from USU documented the features of this still-intact 19th century agrarian landscape, as part of the first Historic American Landscape Survey conducted in Utah.  The final concept plan will integrate the Adams house with a system of linked hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails that connect to trails in the Red Cliffs Recreation Area, the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, and the nearby historic Silver Reef mining district.    Based on the conceptual plan, BLM completed an environmental assessment for the proposed development of a non-motorized trail system and an equestrian trailhead. Today the White Reef Trailhead provides access to a trail system that visits 5 public use sites within the Red Cliffs Recreation Area including the Orson B.

In October of 1847, Jefferson Hunt, who had served in the Mormon Battalion in California, led a group of 18 men, 130 pack mules, and a single wagon to southern California to buy cattle, seed grain, and other needed goods.   The party arrived in San Bernardino after 45 days of travel, having reportedly brought the first wagon over the Old Spanish Trail.

In the late 1870s, Mormon colonists had been sent by church leaders to pioneer new settlements along Arizonaâ€™s Little Colorado River.  As the new settlements were remote and isolated, many goods and services could only be obtained from the established Mormon communities of southern Utah.   After 1877, the Arizona Mormon settlers also traveled to St. George, Utah to conduct church business and have their marriage vows solemnized in the newly-completed St. George Temple.  So many newlyweds traveled the wagon road that it came to be known as â€œthe Honeymoon Trailâ€\\u009d.Couples would travel in small groups for safety and companionship to make this long-distance trek across the varied and rugged terrain of northeastern Arizona and southwestern Utah.   This journey typically began in mid-November and required many weeks of hard travel to complete.   The wagons jolted across deep dry washes and slick rock, bogged down in deep sandy soils, and became mired in muddy stream crossings.   At Leeâ€™s Ferry, John D. Lee and his wife Emma provided regular ferry service for travelers, at one of the few feasible crossings of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.   Their journey then took them to Kanab, Utah, south to Pipe Springs, Arizona, finally heading north into Washington County.  Here, the Honeymoon Trail followed Fort Pearce Wash and headed north through the Warner Valley into St. George.  The spring at the historic Fort Pearce site was a popular overnight camping spot for these travelers, some of whom inscribed their names and the dates of their visits on the rocky cliff faces at the spring.   After their marriage ceremonies, the newlyweds would often spend the winter months in St. George, enjoying the social activities of this established community and purchasing needed supplies.  They began the long trip home in the early spring.  The Honeymoon Trail continued in use well into the 20th century, when modern highways were finally constructed across northeastern Arizona.\",\n        \"imglink\": \"https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/052/492/original/under-construction-vector.jpg\",\n        \"lat\": 37.058373,\n        \"location\": \"Utah\",\n        \"lon\": -113.306355,\n        \"natpark\": \"Zion\",\n        \"num_activities\": 1,\n        \"par_org_id\": 126,\n        \"rec_id\": 16454,\n        \"rec_name\": \"Honeymoon-Trail\",\n        \"reservable\": true,\n        \"stay_limit\": true\n    },\n    {\n        \"activities\": \"BIKING,CAMPING,HIKING,HORSEBACK-RIDING,RECREATIONAL-VEHICLES,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PHOTOGRAPHY\",\n        \"description\": \"The Red Cliffs Recreation Area is located just off Interstate 15, 14 miles northeast of St. George, Utah.

The mountains, plateau, and mesa that make up the forest will always provide a scenic backdrop and thus a component of the quality of life in the area.Â We invite you to visit our forest and enjoy the beauty, history and challenges it has to offer.Â Recreation, motor vehicle and quadÂ <a href=\\\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/gmug/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5209288\\\">mapsÂ are available</a>.Â View aÂ <a href=\\\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5194058.pdf\\\">Ranger District</a>Â location map .\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://get.pxhere.com/photo/landscape-driftwood-tree-sand-wilderness-branch-plant-wood-desert-stump-dry-wildlife-scenery-usa-soil-flora-california-savanna-erosion-root-dunes-hot-tourist-attraction-safari-death-valley-scrubs-dead-trees-dry-trees-natural-environment-woody-plant-1353757.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 38.518157,\n            \"location\": \"Colorado\",\n            \"lon\": -107.461042,\n            \"natpark\": \"Black-Canyon-Of-The-Gunnison\",\n            \"num_activities\": 18,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"131\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1052\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Grand-Mesa-Uncompahgre-and-Gunnison-National-Forest\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BIKING,BOATING,CAMPING,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HIKING,HORSEBACK-RIDING,HUNTING,PICNICKING,WINTER-SPORTS,RECREATIONAL-VEHICLES,VISITOR-CENTER,WATER-SPORTS,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,OTHER-RECREATION-CONCESSION-SITE,HOTEL/LODGE/RESORT-FS-OWNED,ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION\",\n            \"description\": \"The <A HREF=\\\"http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Facility.jsp?fac_Name=Angostura+Dam\\\">Angostura Dam</a> and Reservoir are located at the southeast edge of the Black Hills on the Cheyenne River in southwestern South Dakota near the Nebraska border.  The reservoir has approximately  4,407 water surface acres, 4,546 land acres and 42 miles of shoreline. Recreation on this reservoir is managed by the SD Department of Game, Fish and Parks for the Bureau of Reclamation and includes campgrounds, boat ramps, fishing pier and a marina.  Fish species include walleye, bass, northern pike, perch, bluegill, and crappie.Because the reservoir is located on the southeastern edge of the Black Hills and is the only large body of water in an isolated area of arid southwestern South Dakota, it is attractive to migrating waterbirds that follow the eastern edge of the Black Hills.  The lake also provides habitat for migrant passerine species that travel along the Cheyenne River on their twice-yearly flights to and from the north and the west.  The best birding area is along the undeveloped western side.The area is open year-round and an entrance fee is required year-round.

An easy day-trip from the metropolitan areas of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and the nation's capital, Eastern Neck NWR is an increasingly popular nature tourism destination on Maryland's upper Eastern Shore, attracting over 70,000 visitors annually to its waterfront vistas, peaceful walking trails, and \\\"watchable wildlife.\\\"\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://pixnio.com/free-images/wallpapers/tubby-cove-boardwalk-725x544.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 39.021861,\n            \"location\": \"Maryland\",\n            \"lon\": -76.229605,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 12,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1384\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Eastern-Neck-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BOATING,CAMPING,FISHING,HIKING,HORSEBACK-RIDING,OFF-HIGHWAY-VEHICLE,PICNICKING,WATER-SPORTS,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PLAYGROUND-PARK-SPECIALIZED-SPORT-SITE,OTHER-RECREATION-CONCESSION-SITE,HOTEL/LODGE/RESORT-PRIVATELY-OWNED\",\n            \"description\": \"Keystone Lake's blue-green water and the natural beauty of its setting -- wooded shoreline, sandy beaches, high bluffs, grasslands, and low rolling hills -- make it a visual treat the year round.

The lake is on the Arkansas River 15 miles west of downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma. This 26,000 acre lake is truly an urban playground. There are 16 recreation areas (3 with alcohol free beaches); 11 boat ramps, miles of sandy beaches, 3 marinas, 2 off-road vehicle areas, 5 short distance trails, a waterfowl refuge, 3 seasonal green tree reservoirs, and thousands of acres of land open to public hunting. Camping facilities range from primitive to full hook up. Cabins are available at Keystone State Park. Boat rentals are available through Keyport Marina and Pier 51. Keystone Lake is noted for its striped bass, sand bass, black bass, lake strain small mouth bass, crappie, and catfish. Downstream fisheries are accessible from Whitewater and Brush Creek Parks. Swift Park (a day use Tulsa County park) provides boat access to the Arkansas River below the lake when water levels are adequate. Hunting and fishing are regulated by state and Federal laws. The same licenses are required as in the other parts of the State of Oklahoma. Services and supplies are available at commercial concessions on the lake. Overnight accommodations are available in nearby communities.

Project land extends northward into Kansas, ending near Arkansas City. The lake covers 17,000 surface acres and has 168 miles of shoreline at the normal elevation of 1010.00 feet above sea level. Ground breaking ceremonies were held in May 1966 and impoundment of the reservoir occurred in 1976. Construction on the recreation facilities concluded in July of 1980 with the completion of the Osage Cove Public Use Area.   There are nine public use areas and two lake access points located around the lake for visitors to enjoy. Campers can select from over 300 family campsites, many of which are equipped with water and electric hookups. Groups of all types enjoy four group camping areas, three of which are located at the Osage Cove Public Use Area and one located at the Sarge Creek Cove Area. Use of the group camping areas is by reservation only. Interested parties can contact the Kaw Lake Office for reservations. Ten boat launching ramps provide boaters with easy access to Kaw Lake. Once on the water, boaters can find two full service marinas located at McFadden Cove and Pioneer Park. Swimmers are invited to enjoy designated swimming areas at Pioneer Park and Sandy Park.   Kaw Lake and the Arkansas River have long been known for producing some of Oklahoma's largest catfish. Kaw Lake also offers anglers excellent opportunities to catch crappie, sand (white) bass and walleye. Hunters' skills are tested with excellent populations of whitetail deer, turkey, quail, rabbit and squirrel. During the fall waterfowl seasons Kaw Lake often attracts large numbers of migrating ducks and geese.   One of Kaw Lake's most popular winter attractions is the American Bald Eagle. Traditionally, Kaw Lake has one of the states largest populations of wintering bald eagles. Numerous sites around the lake offer visitors excellent opportunities to view our nation's symbol. Peak viewing usually occurs shortly after the first of the year and lasts through January.   Hikers and horseback riders are attracted to the beautiful trails along Kaw Lakes eastern shore. The Eagle View Hiking Trail is approximately 12 miles long and runs between Osage Cove and Burbank Landing. The Five Fingers Equestrian Trail extends from Burbank Landing to the Sarge Creek Cove Public Use Area. Users should be aware that both trails are closed during Oklahoma's deer rifle and primitive firearms seasons.

Located between Syracuse and Rochester, in Seneca and Wayne Counties, Montezuma serves as a major resting area for waterfowl and other waterbirds on their journeys to and from nesting areas in northeastern and east-central Canada. Fall peaks of Canada geese reach over 60,000 birds; in spring this number has exceeded 100,000.  Spring migration peaks of snow geese have recently exceeded 100,000 birds.  Late fall use by mallards has exceeded 100,000 birds.  Use by American black ducks in the fall often reaches 25,000. Bald eagles have resided on the refuge since 1986, first producing offspring in 1987. Several pair of osprey also nest on the refuge.  There are established nesting colonies of black terns, black-crowned night-herons, and great blue herons.  Dewatered refuge impoundments provide significant foraging habitat for shorebirds during the late summer and fall. Currently, the refuge consists of more than 8,000 acres as efforts to restore and preserve the marsh continue with the Montezuma Wetlands Complex. This project involves the Service, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, conservation organizations, corporations, and private landowners, all working together to restore and enhance wetland habitats and the populations of wetland-dependant wildlife on 36,050 acres of the former Montezuma Marsh. The Montezuma Wetlands Complex is part of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, an international agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico that seeks to restore, conserve, and enhance wetland habitats and waterfowl populations throughout North America.  The National Audubon Society recognized the Montezuma Wetlands Complex as its first Important Bird Area in New York, as well as a Globally Important Bird Area.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://pixnio.com/free-images/nature-landscapes/national-parks-reserves/a-scenic-view-of-the-montezuma-national-wildlife-refuge.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 42.966987,\n            \"location\": \"New-York\",\n            \"lon\": -76.740909,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 11,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1524\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Montezuma-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BOATING,CAMPING,FISHING,HIKING,HORSEBACK-RIDING,HUNTING,PICNICKING,RECREATIONAL-VEHICLES,WATER-SPORTS,SWIMMING-SITE,OTHER-RECREATION-CONCESSION-SITE\",\n            \"description\": \"<A HREF=\\\"http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Facility.jsp?fac_Name=Foss+Dam\\\">Foss Dam</a> and Reservoir, on the Washita River in Custer County, provide regulation of the river flows and municipal and industrial water supplies for several cities in Oklahoma.

Just the fact that there are 10 marinas and over 20 launching ramps here should tell you something. Camping is also big on Tenkiller with 14 campgrounds operated by the Corps, State of Oklahoma, and concessionaires. Types of camping range from primitive to full hookup and are pretty evenly spread out from one end of the lake to the other.   Another outdoor activity while in the lake area would be to hike one or more of the three nature trails. The trails vary in length from 1 1/4 miles to over 2 miles. Spectacular vistas, rock formations and many species of wildlife are just a few of the things to take in as you hike along.   Almost all project lands are open to public hunting except for parks and around the dam and control structures. Principal species hunted are whitetail deer, turkey, rabbit and squirrel. A map of public hunting areas is available from the project office and it is included in the public hunting atlas published by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. State laws apply on these lands so be familiar with the rules before you hunt or fish. Most of all, the Corps of Engineers at Tenkiller Ferry Lake wants you to have a safe and enjoyable visit.

Wister Lake was authorized for flood control and conservation by the Flood Control Act of 1938. The project was designed and built by the Tulsa District Corps of Engineers. Construction began in April 1946, and the project was placed in full flood control operation in December 1949.   One of the most significant things about Wister Lake is that the Wister Project is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The area around Wister Lake has been inhabited for thousands of years. Numerous mounds created by the prehistoric Native Americans still exist in the area.   Visitors to Wister Lake will find a variety of sightseeing opportunities to enjoy. Organized groups from distant points come to this area annually to see the magnificent fall foliage which consists of beautiful trees, native grasses, and wild flowers.   This man-made lake offers many opportunities for outdoor fun and sports. In addition to hunting, fishing, camping, picnicking and swimming, there is hunting, bird watching, and photography.   Local Attractions of Interest   The home of Peter Conser, leader of the famed Choctaw Lighthorse police or soldiers is located three miles west of Hodgens. Conser operated a blacksmith shop, gristmill, general store, and post office. Excellent horses were always kept in the rail corral around the barn for the Choctaw Lighthorsemen.   The home of the late US Senator and Mrs. Robert S. Kerr is located about five miles southwest of Poteau. The magnificent mansion, containing many of the late Senator's office furnishings and personal items, is now the Kerr museum, conference center, and a bed and breakfast facility.   Also in this area is the Heavener Runestone. The runestone is believed to be a land claim made by a Viking explorer prior to 1000 A.D. It is located in the Heavener Runestone State Park near the city of Heavener.   The nearby Quachita Mountains is a gateway to the beautiful Quachita National Forest. Located within the National Forest is the Winding Stair National Scenic Byway.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/03/24/23/08/lake-688309_960_720.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 34.93833,\n            \"location\": \"Oklahoma\",\n            \"lon\": -94.71667,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 10,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"130\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"575\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Wister-Lake\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BOATING,CAMPING,FISHING,HIKING,PICNICKING,WATER-SPORTS,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PLAYGROUND-PARK-SPECIALIZED-SPORT-SITE,OTHER-RECREATION-CONCESSION-SITE,HOTEL/LODGE/RESORT-PRIVATELY-OWNED\",\n            \"description\": \"The McCurtain County Wilderness Area at the lake's north end retains its primitive, natural beauty.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/11/02/01/26/lake-513419_960_720.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 34.145816,\n            \"location\": \"Oklahoma\",\n            \"lon\": -94.685218,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 10,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"130\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"548\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Broken-Bow-Lake\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BOATING,CAMPING,FISHING,HORSEBACK-RIDING,PICNICKING,WATER-SPORTS,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PLAYGROUND-PARK-SPECIALIZED-SPORT-SITE,OTHER-RECREATION-CONCESSION-SITE,HOTEL/LODGE/RESORT-PRIVATELY-OWNED\",\n            \"description\": \"Oologah Lake provides a great getaway for fishing, boating, picnicking, camping or just driftin' and dreaming over the sky blue waters.

The sandhills are characterized by continuous grass and forb-covered dunes and swales and are considered to be the largest body of sand in the world that is not a desert. Where the swales dip below the water table, sub-irrigated meadows, marshes, and lakes have formed. In most cases, no stream systems exist between wetlands. Many lakes are maintained solely by underground water sources. The 45,849-acre Refuge is largely grasslands dotted with hundreds of permanent, semipermanent, and temporary wetlands.

Harris Neck's 2,762 acres consists of saltwater marsh, grassland, mixed deciduous woods, and cropland.  Because of this great variety in habitat, many different species of birds are attracted to the refuge throughout the year.  In the summer, thousands of egrets and herons nest in the swamps, while in the winter, large concentrations of ducks (especially mallards, gadwall and teal) gather in the marshland and freshwater pools. Over 15 miles of paved roads and trails provide the visitor easy access to the many different habitats.

The 6,671 acre Headquarters Unit borders nine miles of the northeast shore of Catahoula Lake, a 26,000 acre natural wetland renowned for its large concentrations of migratory waterfowl.  The 18,491 acre Bushley Bayou Unit, located 8 miles west of Jonesville, was established May 16, 2001.  This acquisition was made possible through a partnership agreement between The Conservation Fund, American Electric Power, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.  The habitat found at the refuge is primarily lowland hardwood forest subject to seasonal backwater flooding from the Ouachita, Black, and Red Rivers. White-tailed deer, small game mammals, songbirds, raptors, waterbirds, reptiles, and amphibians are commonly seen throughout the refuge.  Waterfowl are abundant during the winter. Peak waterfowl populations of 75,000 ducks have been recorded. In 1979, the Duck Lake Impoundment was created to provide 1200 acres of waterfowl habitat.  Management of the impoundment is to manipulate water levels to promote the growth of aquatic and moist soil vegetation.  In 2001, Catahoula NWR was designated a Globally Important Bird Area.  Catahoula Lake is recognized as a Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR site):  a historic concentration area for shorebirds, waterbirds, and migrating/wintering waterfowl. Catahoula NWR also borders a portion of the Dewey Wills Wildlife Management Area.

The vegetation types occurring on the refuge are primarily water tolerant grasses, sedges, and shrubs.  Vegetation in the undeveloped marshes is dominated by bulltongue and maidencane. The habitat is divided into 16,500 acres of natural, freshwater marsh and open water, 16,000 acres of managed, freshwater marsh (Lacassine Pool), 2,200 acres of rice, wheat, soybean, and natural moist soil fields, 350 acres of flooded gum and cypress trees, and 350 acres of restored tallgrass prairie. Wildlife species found on the refuge are those indigenous to the marshes of coastal Louisiana. Several nesting colonies of wading and water birds such as ibis, roseate spoonbills, and egrets are found here. A large population of alligators and furbearers such as nutria and raccoon are also found on the refuge. Endangered species reported on the refuge include bald  eagles, peregrine falcons, and Louisiana black bears. Several hundred thousand ducks and geese use the refuge as wintering habitat while wood ducks, fulvous and black-bellied whistling ducks, and mottled ducks nest on the refuge during the breeding season. Recreational opportunities for refuge visitors abound! The refuge offers fishing, hunting, boating, wildlife observation, and hiking. Lacassine NWR, known for attracting thousands of pintails each winter (a peak of 300,000), has also seen the effects of the decreasing populations. The refuge hosted numbers well over 100,000 until the mid-1980's then saw the peaks reduced by half in the 1990's.  The last three drought years have seen the peaks decline from 30,000 down to around 18,000.

The lake offers the visitor extensive opportunities for a memorable outdoor recreation experience. Overnight accommodations, services and supplies are available at nearby communities.   Waurika dam is located on Beaver Creek, a tributary of the Red River, about six miles northwest of Waurika, Oklahoma. The lake lies in portions of Jefferson, Cotton and Stephens Counties.  The primary authorized project purposes for Waurika Lake are to provide flood control, irrigation, water supply, water quality, fish and wildlife, recreation and other conservation needs of the public.   The operation of the project provides a high degree of flood protection for Beaver Creek Valley below the dam and some protection for a limited area along the Red River. Storage is provided for municipal and industrial water supply needs and water conveyance facilities are provided to supply present and future urban needs.   Waurika Lake provides excellent opportunities for fishing and hunting. Principle species of fish available for the angler include channel catfish, flathead catfish, largemouth bass, white bass, hybrid striper, crappie, walleye, and sunfish.   Approximately 6,040 acres of project lands have been made available to the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation for wildlife management purposes. These lands are managed for upland game, whitetail deer and waterfowl and are open to the public as a public hunting area. Species most sought by hunters include whitetail deer, bobwhite quail, mourning dove, wood ducks, mallards, pintail, teal, canvas back, cottontail rabbits and wild turkey.   The scenic irregular shoreline and gently sloping land to the water's edge is an open invitation for outdoors family fun and relaxation. There are six recreation areas located around the lake that include such facilities as boat launching ramps, campgrounds, sanitary facilities, picnic tables and shelters.   Boating and skiing enthusiasts will be pleased with the large areas of open water and the scenic shoreline.

Wheeler NWR is comprised of a great diversity of habitat types such as bottomland hardwoods, wetlands, pine uplands, agricultural fields, and backwater embayments.  These habitats provide excellent feeding, loafing, and roosting sites for waterfowl, as well as nesting sites for migrating songbirds.  The Refuge provides a much needed oasis in one of the fastest growing regions in the state, with Madison being ranked as one of the top ten fasting growing cities in the nation in 2002.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://static.rootsrated.com/image/upload/s--sRGFc6w7--/t_rr_large_traditional/tk5qllwltp3k9hbav8vw.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 34.56169891,\n            \"location\": \"Alabama\",\n            \"lon\": -86.79060364,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 9,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1670\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Wheeler-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"AUTO-TOURING,HISTORIC-&-CULTURAL-SITE,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,HIKING,HUNTING,VISITOR-CENTER,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION,PHOTOGRAPHY\",\n            \"description\": \"Since 1937, Bombay Hook has hosted hundreds of thousands of migrating ducks, geese, shorebirds, and neotropical songbirds, all following old traditions of natural history, the spring and fall migrations.

Each year, especially during the fall, spectacular flights of ducks and geese mark the changing seasons along this traditional waterfowl flyway. An interesting assortment of warblers, raptors, shorebirds, and other bird life can be observed also. The 1968 excavation of the steamboat Bertrand, which sank in 1865, adds a major historical emphasis to the refuge program. The 200,000 pieces in the Bertrand Collection provide one of the most significant assemblages of Civil War era artifacts in the country. A former oxbow of the Missouri River, DeSoto Lake, provides recreational use for up to 250,000 visitors annually.

Since that time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been acquiring bottomland hardwood habitat in the Pearl River Basin. On December 13, 1989, Congress authorized a boundary expansion for Bogue Chitto NWR that included an additional 8,400 acres of bottomland hardwoods in St. Tammany Parish. To date, some 36,447 acres have been placed under refuge management. The refuge is still in an acquisition phase. White-tail deer, squirrel, turkey and hog hunting and fishing is offered to the public. The endangered and threatended species found on the refuge are bald eagle, ringed-sawback turtle, gopher tortoise, inflated heelsplitter mussel, and gulf sturgeon.  Access is primarily by boat on the refuge's Louisiana side and road access is available on the refuge's Mississippi side.  In Summer 2002, a new walking trail was unveiled on the Louisiana side of the Refuge.  This 3/4 of a mile walking trail offers a unique journey into the interior of Bogue Chitto's majestic habitat. Bogue Chitto NWR is primarily composed of bottomland hardwood habitat interlaced by the Bogue Chitto and Pearl River Systems.  Numerous sloughs, bayous and lakes are located on the refuge.  Water levels fluctuate by several feet from their low point in the summer to winter/spring flood stage.  Over 90% of the refuge can be flooded during seasonal high river periods.  The mixed hardwood forest includes water oak, overcup oak, American elm, sweetgum, and swamp red maple on higher elevations and bald cypress, tupelo gum, and swamp blackgum along the wettest areas.  Mid-story in mixed hardwoods includes ironwood, arrowwood, Virginia willow and reproduction of the overstory.  Typical mid-story plants along the sloughs and bayous are buttonbush, swamp privet, and water elm. The Refuge offers hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, hiking, primitive streamside camping, birding, photography and canoeing.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3706/9294964558_3897d13d9d_z.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 30.321699,\n            \"location\": \"Louisiana\",\n            \"lon\": -89.937221,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 9,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1312\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Bogue-Chitto-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"AUTO-TOURING,BOATING,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HUNTING,VISITOR-CENTER,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PHOTOGRAPHY,PADDLING\",\n            \"description\": \"Cameron Prairie National Wildlife Refuge was established to preserve and protect wintering waterfowl and their habitat.

The terrain within its 40 acres consists of a sandstone finger of a mesa and the upper reach of the Beartrap Canyon. At a top elevation of 7,500 feet, both the mesa top and canyon bottom sustains Utah juniper and ponderosa and pinyon pine trees. Despite its small size, but because of its proximity to adjacent wilderness and other relatively undisturbed lands, a wide variety of wildlife lives here.

This makes a large portion of the refuge accessable only by boat. Due to its location along the Tombigbee River, the entire refuge is subject to annual Spring flooding. The primary purpose of the refuge is to provide wood duck brood habitat and serve as a protected wintering area for waterfowl. Up to 200 broods of wood ducks are produced anually in the refuge's artificial nest boxes, and wintering waterfowl numbers can exceed 10,000. In addition, numerous neotropical migrant and wading birds benefit from management activities.  Following a successful bald eagle hacking program in the early 1990's the refuge has played host to a nesting pair of eagles each winter. During the summer months wood storks can be found resting and feeding in the back-water sloughs and moist soil units. Resident wildlife includes white-tailed deer, gray squirrels, turkey, raccoons, opossum, American alligator, and beaver.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://cdn4.picryl.com/photo/2014/01/01/grassland-within-the-santa-ana-national-wildlife-refuge-on-the-rio-grande-river-640.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 31.84496,\n            \"location\": \"Alabama\",\n            \"lon\": -88.165946,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 8,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1349\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Choctaw-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BOATING,CAMPING,HIKING,PICNICKING,WATER-SPORTS,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PLAYGROUND-PARK-SPECIALIZED-SPORT-SITE,ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION\",\n            \"description\": \"This 200-acre lake is popular with bass fishermen and anglers of all ages alike.

The complex was established in 1958 for the protection of migratory birds and spans 350 miles along the Mississippi River in the states of Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri.  It includes Port Louisa, Two Rivers, Great River, Clarence Cannon, and Middle Mississippi River refuges. Middle Miss Refuge lands were purchased in response to the great flood of 1993 and are unique in the refuge complex. The refuge tracts lie within the uncontrolled portion of the Middle Mississippi River, below the confluence with the Missouri, where river levels are not regulated by the lock and dam system.  Water levels may fluctuate greatly in this \\\"open river\\\" section of the Mississippi, and frequent flooding occurs on these lands. Much of the refuge land had previously been cut off from the floodplain by private levees that protected acgricultural lands.  Most of the levees were breached by the 1993 flood and will not be repaired.  These lands will provide access to the floodplain for native fish during high water stages and create a corridor of floodplain forest habitat for migratory birds and resident wildlife.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://pixnio.com/free-images/nature-landscapes/canyon/cabeza-prieta-national-wildlife-refuge-arizona-usa-180x225.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 37.854469,\n            \"location\": \"Illinois\",\n            \"lon\": -89.727161,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 8,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"4055\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Middle-Mississippi-River-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BOATING,CAMPING,FISHING,HIKING,PICNICKING,WATER-SPORTS,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PLAYGROUND-PARK-SPECIALIZED-SPORT-SITE\",\n            \"description\": \"If you enjoy camping, boating, fishing, hunting, or wildlife watching - we have the place for you.

Camping and picnicking opportunities are numerous with 171 campsites located in four parks - Cottonwood Point, Hillsboro Cove, Marion Cove, and French Creek Cove.   Campsites contain picnic tables, grills and/or fire-rings, sun-shelters and gravel parking pads. Facilities at our class \\\"A\\\" parks, Cottonwood Point and Hillsboro Cove, include electrical hookups, showers, RV dump stations, group camping areas, group picnic areas, playgrounds, and beaches. Potable water is available in all parks. Cottonwood Point also includes some sites with 50 amp electrical service and individual water hookups.   A special treat for wildlife observers is the 1-mile Willow Walk Nature Trail located at Cottonwood Point.   Maps and information on specific facilities, fees, the Golden Age/Access discount and park regulations are available from gate attendants, park rangers, or the project office at (316) 382-2101.   Anglers have bright opportunities at Marion Reservoir. The lake is noted for its walleye, crappie, white bass, wipers and channel catfish. The lake also contains largemouth bass, and a good population of lunker-size flathead catfish. An 18-inch length limit is in effect for walleyes and black bass. Fish feeders are located in Hillsboro Cove and Cottonwood Point.   Boaters will find boat ramps located around the lake at Cottonwood Point (2 ramps, 4 lanes), Hillsboro Cove, Marion Cove (2 lanes), French Creek, Durham Cove and Broken Bridge. Developed ramps provide lights and courtesy docks. There is a fee to use these ramps. The undeveloped ramps at Durham Cove and Broken Bridge are free.   Hunters at Marion Reservoir will find a mixed bag including pheasants, quail, rabbits, turkeys, and white-tail deer. Waterfowl hunters will find good populations of Canada, snow, and white-front geese as well as all species of ducks found within the Central Flyway.   The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks maintains a large percentage of the perimeter of the lake as a public hunting area. A map showing the location of this public hunting land may be obtained at the project office. The Department also maintains a waterfowl refuge at Marion Reservoir located just east of French Creek Cove that is off-limits to the public.

The Brigantine and Barnegat Divisions were originally two distinct refuges, established in 1939 and 1967 respectively, to provide important wintering habitat for waterfowl, especially black ducks and Atlantic brant. The Divisions were combined in 1984 under the Edwin B. Forsythe name, in honor of the late conservationist Congressman from New Jersey.  The refuge complex covers approximately 46,000 acres in three counties including Atlantic, Burlington, and Ocean. Nearly 80 percent of Forsythe Refuge is tidal salt meadow and marsh, interspersed with shallow coves and bays. Most of the remainder of the refuge acreage is woodlands dominated by pitch pines, oaks, and white cedar, with some fields which are maintained to provide habitat diversity.  More than 6,000 acres are designated as Wilderness Area. This includes Holgate and Little Beach, two of the few remaining undeveloped barrier beaches in New Jersey. These pristine sites provide critical nesting habitat for threatened piping plovers and a wide variety of other beachnesting species. Beaches and dunes provide nesting habitat for piping plovers, black skimmers and least terns. Occasionally peregrine falcons, bald eagles and osprey are seen. Each spring and fall, thousands of water birds stop at Forsythe Refuge during their long migrations.  Waterfowl, wading birds, and shore birds may be viewed from the Wildlife Drive as they feed and rest.  Refuge uplands also provide important stopover habitat for migrating passerines. Forsythe is a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site, a Wetlands of International Importance site under the Ramsar Convention, and an important birding area. It also is a part of The Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve and The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail. In 2002 the refuge was the recipient of the New Jersey Governor's Eco-Tourism Award.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://www.goodfreephotos.com/albums/united-states/new-jersey/other-new-jersey/houses-on-edge-of-edwin-b-forsythe--wildlife-refuge.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 39.46386,\n            \"location\": \"New-Jersey\",\n            \"lon\": -74.450623,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 8,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1386\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Edwin-B.-Forsythe-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BOATING,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,WINTER-SPORTS,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PADDLING\",\n            \"description\": \"Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge lies midway between Buffalo and Rochester, NY, within the Atlantic Flyway.

River channelization, wetland drainage, and conversion of river bottom floodplain areas to agricultural, industrial, and municipal uses had resulted in the loss of over 500,000 acres of habitat along the navigable stretch of the Missouri River floodplain. The Boyer Chute project is a joint Federal and local conservation partnership success story. The project has restored the area to near pre-channelization condition without affecting navigation on the main stem of the Missouri River. Boyer Chute is once again a functioning part of the river. Close to 3,350 acres of floodplain woodland, tallgrass prairie, and wetland habitats now benefit Missouri River fishes, migratory birds, endangered species, and resident wildlife. Boyer Chute is self guiding. Floods in 2011 changed the look and the habitats of the refuge. The north and south sections of the auto tour loop are open.  The Sauger Fishing Pier along the south section of road is open, but the Catfish Fishing Pier just south of the Refuge Entrance will remain closed indefinitely.

The refuge was established in 1973 with the transfer of 28 acres from the U.S. Coast Guard, and has grown to it's current size of 127 acres today. Block Island National Wildlife Refuge is administered as part of the Rhode Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex, which manages all five of the National Wildlife Refuges in Rhode Island, and is headquartered in Charlestown, Rhode Island. The new Kettle Pond Visitor Center and headquarters located in Charlestown, RI,which opened in October 2005,  celebrates the  John H. Chafee National Wildlife Refuge and all of the other refuges in Rhode Island. This facility contains interactive exhibits, displays, a sales area, classrooms for speciel events, and knowledgeable people where visitors can come and explore the refuges and learn about the wildlife resources and coastal environments of each refuge. Refuge lands on Block Island are most notable for the large concentration (over 70 species) of migratory songbirds which visit the area each fall.  Located in the Atlantic flyway, many young, inexperienced songbirds \\\"overfly\\\" the mainland and stopover on Block Island before continuing their migration.  The result is a cornucopia of young migratory songbirds from a variety of  different species. Block Island is internationally recognized as one of the most important migratory bird habitats on the east Coast, attracting hundreds of \\\"birders\\\" to the Island each fall. The refuge also provides habitat for the Endangered American Burying Beetle, supporting the only population of this species known East of the Mississippi River.   Piping plover occur on the Island (a threatened Species) as do four other State species of concern.

Today, the dam continues to provide flood protection along 67 miles of the Genesee River Valley from the village of Mount Morris to downtown Rochester where the river enters Lake Ontario.    The US Army Corps of Engineers proudly promotes stewardship of public lands and waters.  In fact, the 20 mile upstream section of the Genesee River is safe guarded by the Genesee River Protection Act of 1989, which allows the dam to hold back water only to prevent flooding. Typically, the Genesee flows freely through the dam without interference. However, when the dam is preventing flooding, the water backs up to fill Letchworth Canyon until it can be released at a rate that will not cause flooding downstream.     Mount Morris Dam and Recreation Area is a day use park that offers a beautiful setting overlooking Letchworth Canyon, known as the \\\"Grand Canyon of the East\\\".  Explore the Visitor Center to learn more about the dam or join us for a free ranger guided walking tour of the Mount Morris Dam.

It is an isolated backwater, cut off from the Mississippi and Trempealeau rivers by dikes, providing needed resting and feeding areas for waterfowl and other birds.        The refuge is situated in a unique geological formation known as the driftless area.  Thousands of years ago,    glaciers surrounded but did not pass over the land.  Blown into mounds, sand and silt from melting glaciers     formed the rolling sand prairies of the refuge.        Wetlands are a prominent feature.  Before the railroads arrived and the locks and dams were built,    the lands within the refuge were part of the Mississippi River.  As such, these backwaters experienced floods and     droughts.  Today, using dikes and control structures, managers can mimic this natural cycle by lowering the water    to expose mudflats and allow plants to germinate.

The site was excavated by Brigham Young University's Office of Public Archaeology, in cooperation with the BLM, from 1991 to 1994. Recovered artifacts are currently stored at BYU's Museum of People and Cultures in Provo, Utah. After the excavations, the site was backfilled (reburied with the dirt that was removed during excavation), a necessary step in protecting the cultural features that remain. As a result, the foundations of the village can no longer be seen on the surface. The walls visible today are modern walls, built in 2002.

On the highest plateaus, stands of ponderosa pine are surrounded by cream-colored slickrock. Pinyon pine, Utah juniper, scrub oak, and sagebrush cover the mountain slopes, at lower elevations.  Seeps in the canyon walls provide water for hanging gardens of maidenhair fern, monkeyflower, and columbine. Hawks, falcons, and golden eagles nest along the sandstone walls, while ringtailed cats, deer, cougar, and black bear live on the plateaus and in the canyon bottoms. This wilderness provides opportunities for primitive recreational activities, including hiking, equestrian trail riding, canyoneering, and camping. Several routes exist on the southern end of the wilderness providing access to higher elevations by way of steep canyons.  The Sawmill trail, however, follows an historic logging route and traverses a large portion of the wilderness.

Currently, the refuge protects 15,000 acres, with the vision of a 35,000-acre contiguous tract of land connected by remnants of cypress-tupelo swamps, oak barrens, and vast stands of bottomland forests. The refuge and surrounding Cache River Wetlands are considered Illinois' Bayou - a large swamp/wetland complex in the Midwest which harbors a rich collection of biologically significant natural communities.

The refuge is one of the last remaining marsh areas adjacent to Lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne. The refuge contains a wide variety of habitat including bottomland hardwoods, fresh and brackish water marshes, lagoons, canals, borrow pits, cheniers, and natural bayous.  Most of the refuge is located within massive hurricane protection levees built to protect New Orleans East from storm surges and flooding, thusly a network of pumps and flapgates provide a way of regulating water levels seasonally to encourage the summer growth of emergent plants that in turn provide waterfowl food supplies in the winter. The American Alligator is the most common predator on the refuge that also help control the number of rodents as well as the exotic nutria.  This diverse habitat supports 340 bird species and waterfowl in the number of 50,000 use the wetland areas during the fall, winter and early spring months.  The city of New Orleans was the recipient of the first US Fish and Wildlife Service Urban Treaty for Bird Conservation grant which educated youth about birds and bird habitat on the refuge.

The refuge was once part of a vast bottomland hardwood wilderness. Levees have changed hydrology, but the underlying ridge/Saale topography supports a variety of habitat types. Bottomland hardwood forest, croplands, fallow fields, moist soil units, and cypress-tupelo brakes are intermixed with meandering bayous, pristine lakes, ponds, sloughs, and the Red River. This variety of vegetative communities in turn supports a diversity of wildlife. Due to its location in east-central Louisiana, the refuge is served by the Mississippi and Central Flyways. Although mallards, northern pintails, and wood ducks are the most numerous waterfowl species on the refuge, blue- and green-winged teal, northern shovelers, gadwall, and American Widgeon are also common. Primary diving ducks are scaup and ring-necked ducks. Canada, snow, and greater white-fronted geese are present, though less common. Several hundred native species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, fishes, and insects are found on the refuge. Common, though often difficult to see, species include bobcats, alligators, red and grey foxes, turkeys, mink, and otter. More frequently encountered are white-tailed deer, raccoons, fox squirrels, beaver, marsh hawks, and wading birds. Many neotropical migratory songbirds use the refuge at various times. Refuge fisheries are composed largely of largemouth bass, gar, crappie, bowfin, bream species, buffalo, carp, and catfish. Endangered species numbers are few and their presence is always marked with special interest. The arctic peregrine falcon is an occasional visitor, and thanks to the refuge's three-year bald eagle reintroduction project, bald eagle sightings are common.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://pixnio.com/free-images/nature-landscapes/forest/bottomland-hardwood-forest.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 31.109388,\n            \"location\": \"Louisiana\",\n            \"lon\": -92.137944,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 6,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1476\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Lake-Ophelia-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"HISTORIC-&-CULTURAL-SITE,FISHING,HIKING,VISITOR-CENTER,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PHOTOGRAPHY\",\n            \"description\": \"Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was established in 1944 to provide habitat for migratory birds.

Approximately half of the refuge consists of aquatic habitats including bay with marine seagrass beds, intertidal saltmarsh, high saltmarsh, freshwater marsh, shrub swamp, and red maple swamp. The refuge's saltmarshes, combined with the adjacent New York State-owned saltmarsh, form the largest continuous saltmarsh on Long Island.         The remaining half of the refuge is upland featuring the rare Pine Barren habitats of pitch pine, oak-pine, mixed oak, pioneer hardwood, upland shrub, and grasslands.          The refuge's wildlife populations are quite diverse.  About 300 species of birds have been documented at Wertheim. The refuge winters up to 5,000 waterfowl, the majority being black ducks - a species in nationwide decline. The coastal location also makes this refuge an excellent migration corridor for shorebirds, raptors and songbirds.         The main purpose for establishing the refuge was to protect the Carmans River Estuary for migratory birds.  The River is a NY State-designated Wild and Scenic river and one of the Island's largest.

The WSA is 4,433 acres and measures approximately 6 miles from north to south and 3 miles from east to west. Private and state land surrounds most of the WSA with the state land nearly bisecting the study area. The southern boundary adjoins Zion National Park. All land within the WSA is managed by the BLM Cedar City Field Office. Spring Creek Canyon WSA includes a portion of the Hurricane Cliffs, an awesome west facing escarpment that extends from north of Cedar City into northwestern Arizona. Two major canyons, Kanarra Falls and Spring Creek Canyon, bisect the WSA with elevations ranging from 5,600 feet at the base of the cliffs to almost 7,900 feet on the ridge tops. Vegetation consists primarily of juniper, scrub oak, shrubs, and grasses; however, along the riparian zone, sedges, rushes, cottonwoods, and willows are prevalent. The area provides habitat for various birds of prey such as the bald eagle and peregrine falcon as well as 13 species of animals and 4 plant species that are considered sensitive.  The majority of the WSA is rated outstanding for scenic quality due to the stunning, narrow red rock canyons that offer spectacular hiking along the streambeds. In particular, hiking in Kanarra Canyon involves traveling (and sometimes wading) along Kanarra Creek and climbing up and over several beautiful waterfalls.

Big Timber is a forested backwater slough open to the Mississippi River. Keithsburg is a forested backwater slough leveed off from the Mississippi. The newest division, Horseshoe Bend, is being restored to native vegetation, including bottomland hardwoods, wetlands, and native prairie. It is open to floodwaters of the Iowa River.

A presidential proclamation in 1940 changed its designation from Blackbeard Island Reservation to Blackbeard Island National Wildlife Refuge.  In 1975, three thousand acres of the refuge were set aside as National Wilderness.  Blackbeard Island was named for Edward Teach, alias Balckbeard the Pirate. Rumors of Blackbeard's buried treasure still flourish, but no evidence of his fortune has ever been discovered. The island is comprised of interconnecting linear dunes thickly covered by oak/palmetto vegetation. There are approximately 1,163 acres of open freshwater or freshwater marsh, 2,000 acres of regularly flooded salt marsh, 2,115 acres of maritime forest, and 340 acres of sandy beach. The primary objectives of the refuge are to provide wintering habitat and protection for migratory birds; provide protection and habitat to promote resident and migratory wildlife diversity; and to provide protection and management for endangered and threatened species (loggerhead sea turtle, American bald eagle, wood stork, piping plover).

Habitats that support these species are also home to other glacial-relict snail and plant species that require specific cool moist conditions to live. These species occur only on algific talus slopes or moist sandstone cliffs. In these fragile places, constant cold air exiting from a cliff or talus slope creates a unique microclimate, one that may be considerably different from areas only meters away. The refuge is currently 775 acres, consisting of nine units in four counties in northeastern Iowa. When the proposed acquisition is completed, at least 70 percent of the known northern monkshood population and 75 percent of the known population of the Iowa Pleistocene snail will be protected.

The first spur on the left leads to a view point high above Spanish Valley. The second spur route ends after 200 yards at another view point. Ahead to the south, the view is dominated by a long ridge of massive sandstone fins. From the intersection, the main route drops down into a wash and then climbs in an easterly direction to its terminus just below the pass to Hidden Valley.

The refuge is comprised of a series of barrier islands including Breton Island and all of the Chandeleur Islands in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. It was formed from the remnants of the Mississippi River's former St.Bernard Delta, which was active 2000 years ago.  The barrier islands size and shapes constantly are altered by tropical storms, wind, and tidal action.  The area above mean high tide is approximately 6,923 acres.  In 1975, the refuge was established as a National Wilderness Area.  And in 1990, an agreement with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service authorizing the service management rights and law enforcement authority on additional State of Louisiana owned lands.  The agreement increased the refuge by an additional 11,350 acres for a total of 18,273 acres. The objectives for the refuge are to provide sanctuary for nesting and wintering seabirds, protect and preserve the wilderness character of the islands, and provide sandy beach habitat for a variety of wildlife species.  Twenty-three species of seabirds and shorebirds frequently use the refuge, and thirteen species nest on the various islands.  The most abundant nesters are brown pelicans, laughing gulls, and royal, caspian, and sandwich terns.  Over ten thousand brown pelicans have been recorded nesting on the refuge.  Endangered and threatened species such as the least tern, brown pelican, and piping plover are common to the refuge.

The refuge was established in 1986 to provide for 1) conservation and management of all fish and wildlife within the refuge, 2) to fulfill the international treaty obligations of the United States with respect to fish and wildlife, and 3) to provide opportunities for scientific research, environmental education, and fish and wildlife oriented recreation, including hunting, fishing and trapping, birdwatching, nature photography, and others. The refuge is encompassed within nearly one-half million acres of hardwood swamps, lakes and bayous.   The natural floodplain of the Atchafalaya River flows for 140 miles south from its junction with the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.   The basin's dense bottomland hardwoods, cypress-tupelo swamps, overflow lakes, and meandering bayous provide a tremendous diversity of habitat for more than 200 species of resident and migratory birds and numerous other wildlife and the area has been recognized as an Internationally Important Bird Area.  The basin's wooded wetlands also provide vital nesting habitat for wood ducks, and support the nation's largest concentration of American woodcock.   Eagles, ospreys,  swallow-tailed kites, and Mississippi kites can occasionally be seen soaring overhead.  Wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, gray and fox squirrels, eastern cottontail, swamp rabbit, gray and red fox, coyote, striped skunk, and opposum inhabit the refuge, as do a small remnant population of black bears.  Furbearers found in this great swamp are raccoon, mink, bobcat, nutria, muskrat, river otter, and beaver. The lifeblood of the fishery is the basin's annual flooding and dewatering cycle.  Overflows occur during the winter and spring rains, with many areas gradually becoming dewatered during the summer and fall. Sportfishing is popular throughout the basin.  Largemouth bass, white crappie, black crappie, warmouth, bluegill, redear sunfish, and channel catfish  are the primary species sought.  More than 85 species of fish occur in the basin, and their populations frequently exceed 1,000 pounds per acre.  Red swamp crawfish and white river crawfish are also important for both a sport and commercial harvest.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://img2.10bestmedia.com/Images/Photos/305235/Atchafalaya-_54_990x660.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 30.321699,\n            \"location\": \"Louisiana\",\n            \"lon\": -89.937221,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 4,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1280\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Atchafalaya-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BOATING,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HUNTING\",\n            \"description\": \"The refuge provides excellent wintering habitat for tens of thousands of ducks and geese.

Many rare plants, including several orchids, occur on the refuge. A major purpose of the refuge is the protection of the secondary dunes, which have become scarce on Long Island due to development. Long-tailed ducks, white winged scoter, common loon and horned grebe spend winter off the refuge shore, while shorebirds, songbirds and raptors are a treat to visiting wildlife watchers during spring and fall. Merlin, Cooper's hawk, kestrel, sharp-shinned hawk, and peregrine falcon soar over the dunes during migration.

Within the eight-county district, one can travel north through the high river bluffs of Pepin County, to the prairie potholes of St. Croix County, and then to the pine barrens of Burnett County. The district includes Barron, Burnett, Dunn, Washburn, Pierce, Pepin, Polk, and St. Croix counties.  The central portion of St. Croix County, the heart of the district, is known as the Star Prairie Pothole Grasslands.  These grasslands are ranked sixth out of 26 priority grassland landscapes in Wisconsin. The district manages relatively small tracts of prairie wetland and grassland habitats known as waterfowl production areas (WPAs).  WPAs are purchased using Federal Duck Stamp dollars within the historic prairie pothole portion of the district, including southern Polk, St. Croix and Dunn counties.  After purchase, prairie wetland and grassland habitats are restored and then managed for breeding waterfowl, other migratory birds, and indigenous wildlife. The district's 40 WPAs totaling 7,000 acres are administered by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wildlife Refuge System. In addition to managing WPAs, district staff provide assistance to private landowners who wish to manage their land to benefit wildlife. The St. Croix Wetland Management District is adjacent to the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropoitan Area of two million people.  St. Croix County is the second fastest growing county in Wisconsin and has the highest per capita income. This dynamic presents unique opportunities and challenges for prairie wetland habitat preservation, restoration and management.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://emmagraceinstcroixhome.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/img_3027.jpeg?w=1024\",\n            \"lat\": 45.11769867,\n            \"location\": \"Wisconsin\",\n            \"lon\": -92.60769653,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 4,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1618\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"St.-Croix-Wetland-Management-District\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BOATING,CAMPING,HIKING\",\n            \"description\": \"<h2>Overview</h2>Start your Moab adventure at the Big Bend Recreation Site.

The refuge supports an excellent fisheries resource and provides valuable habitat for migratory waterfowl, neotropical migratory songbirds, and many resident wildlife species. This semi-urban refuge is ideally located to provide a place for people to connect with the natural world.  It is one of four refuges managed in the North Louisiana Refuges Complex.  The complex visitor center, a restored planter's house, is situated on the 40 acre Black Bayou Lake Environmental Education Center.  Adjacent to the visitor center are an arboretum with over 100 native Louisiana woody plants and a prairie demonstration area with native grasses and wildflowers.

This stretch features easy boater access, close proximity to the city of Moab, moderate rapids, and wonderful scenery. Depending on water levels, rapids on this section range from Class I to Class III. No permits are required for private trips.  There are a number of commercial outfitters who have permits from the Moab BLM Field Office to offer guided trips on this section of the river.   State of Utah Boating Law requires all boaters to wear life vests.  Current streamflow conditions are available on the U.S Geological Survey website. The BLM maintains parking areas, boat ramps, and campgrounds along the entire stretch, including Hittle Bottom, Rocky Rapid (a.k.a. Ida Gulch), Sandy Beach, and Take Out Boat Ramps.  Special regulations apply for boaters wishing to camp along the \\\"Daily\\\" section. Overnight camping on river right (facing downstream) is allowed only in designated sites between Dewey Bridge and Salt Wash (the boundary of Arches National Park). On river left, people must camp in BLM developed campgrounds (dispersed camping is not allowed on this side of the river in order to protect resources).  Here is a map to help plan your activities along the \\\"Moab Daily\\\". For those wanting a longer trip, the 7.5 mile Dewey Bridge to Hittle Bottom stretch of the Colorado River offers flat water and great views. Roughly half of the trip is within sight of Fisher Towers and the La Sal Mountains. There is a developed, but steep, boat ramp at the Dewey Bridge Campground (please use caution with vehicles) and boater parking is available. No fee is charge for use of this boat ramp. All BLM individual camp sites are first-come, first-served.

The 20 miles of dirt roads on Wassaw Island and seven miles of beach provides an ideal wildlife trail system for hikers.  Birdwatching is particularly fruitful during the spring and fall migrations.        The island supports rookeries for egrets and herons, and a variety of wading birds are abundant in the summer months.

It originated as the throat of a large volcano about 28 million years ago in the Miocene geological epoch, when molten rock intruded between existing sedimentary rocks. The plug may represent the eroded conduit of a laccolith. There are private property parcels around the base, but there is a BLM trail that more or less rings the Needle. <br>Needle Rock lies within the western edge of the West Elk Mountains in western central Colorado. It is the remnant of a volcanic plug that pushed up through the crust, and due to the relative hardness of the basalt of which it is made, has eroded significantly slower than the surrounding mancos shale and sandstone that makes up many of the rocks in the area.

The refuge is adjacent to Kealia Beach, which is a nesting ground for the endangered hawksbill turtle.Kealia Pond serves as a settling basin a 56-square mile watershed that results in seasonal intermittent flooding during winter months and dryer conditions during late summer months. This creates open water (200 acres) and shallow mud flat areas interspersed with vegetation, which provide suitable resting, feeding, and nesting habitat for endangered water birds. During certain times of the year, the refuge supports at least half of the Hawaiian stilt population. The pond also supports a diverse assemblage of migratory birds from late summer (August) to early spring (April). It is one of the most important areas in the state for wintering migratory waterfowl. Migratory shorebirds also congregate here to take advantage of the food resources along the water's edge. As water recedes, fish are crowded into the remaining water, making them easy prey for 'auku'u (black-crowned night herons). Approximately 2,700 people visit the refuge each year to engage in various wildlife-oriented activities, including bird watching, photography, environmental education, habitat restoration projects that involve removal of exotic species, and outplanting with Hawaii's native vegetation.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"http://www.public-domain-image.com/free-images/nature-landscapes/lake/lake-at-two-ponds-national-wildlife-refuge.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 20.7949134,\n            \"location\": \"Hawaii\",\n            \"lon\": -156.46632,\n            \"natpark\": \"Haleakala\",\n            \"num_activities\": 2,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1449\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Kealia-Pond-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"CAMPING,HIKING\",\n            \"description\": \"Water.

It is common to find habitation from these periods along water sources, in this case Quail Creek, where farming of maize and other crops was possible. One or two families lived together in pithouses, and later in multi-roomed surface pueblos. The families at this site were primarily sedentary farmers, cultivating small fields along the creek, but would also gather native plants and hunt. After 1200 A.D. the Ancestral Puebloans abandoned this site, possibly due to prolonged drought periods and climate change.BLM archaeologists excavated this site between 1977 and 1979, assisted by Youth Adult Conservation Corps youth crews. Data from the Red Cliffs site provided knowledge about the Ancestral Puebloan culture and way of life in southwestern Utah, which scientists only had very little familiarity with at the time.

The adventurous nature of this trail requires users to be cautious, personally responsible, and self-sufficient and have a working knowledge of backcountry survival.

Carry plenty of drinking water as it is not readily available along the trail. <br>To reduce damage to the resource, you are encouraged to avoid the area when wet conditions exist. It is difficult, but not impossible, for high-clearance 4-wheel drive vehicles to travel all but single-track sections of the trail. Users are urged to respect all property rights by closing gates, being watchful for livestock, and camping only in approved camping areas. Users should also be aware that the Uncompahgre Plateau is a nationally renowned hunting area, and during the hunting season, it is highly recommended that you wear orange hats and jackets.

The refuge is located in north Key Largo and is currently comprised of 6,700 acres including 650 acres of open water.  It contains a mosaic of habitat types including tropical hardwood hammock, mangrove forest, and salt marsh.  These habitats are critical for hundreds of plants and animals including six federally-listed species.Crocodile Lake NWR is unusual in that not all of the critical habitat areas are in a pristine, undisturbed condition.  A large portion of the refuge was going to be a residential development complete with canals for boating access.  The dredge-spoil from the canal system was piled up in berms on the banks of the canals and became an important nesting area for the federally-listed American crocodile.  American crocodiles are fairly wide-spread throughout the tropics, however, in the U.S. crocodiles are only found in south Florida and the Keys. The refuge protects one of the largest remaining tracts of tropical hardwood hammock which is a globally threatened habitat type.  These diverse forests are home to hundreds of plants and animals including the federally-listed Key Largo woodrat, Key Largo cotton mouse, Schaus swallowtail butterfly, Stock Island tree snail, and Eastern indigo snake.  These species require hammocks in order to survive.  Unfortunately, most of the hammocks in Key Largo have been eliminated by development which has lead to considerable population declines in these already imperiled species.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://pixnio.com/free-images/nature-landscapes/national-parks-reserves/alaska-peninsula-national-wildlife-refuge-landscape-300x199.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 25.191763,\n            \"location\": \"Florida\",\n            \"lon\": -80.356482,\n            \"natpark\": \"Biscayne\",\n            \"num_activities\": 1,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"3944\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Crocodile-Lake-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"WILDERNESS\",\n            \"description\": \"The Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area encompasses Gunnison Gorge Wilderness, Flat Top-Peach Valley, and Gunnison River Recreation Area.

Adams House    The St. George Field Office has completed rehabilitation of a mid-19th century Mormon pioneer residence for adaptive re-use.  This small sandstone masonry house was built in 1863 for the Orson B. Adams family, in the now abandoned Mormon agricultural settlement of Harrisburg, located approximately 15 miles north of St. George.   Critical to the successful completion of the rehabilitation project were partnerships with Washington County, the Utah Heritage Foundation, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation; technical assistance from the Utah State Historic Preservation Office; and volunteer labor during several phases of the project.  The Adams house is open sporadically for public visitation with the assistance of volunteer docents.      In 2004, Washington County, Utah State University (USU), and the Utah Chapter-American Society of Landscape Architects worked with BLM to create a conceptual plan for public recreation use of the 215 acres that surround the Adams house.  Quail Creek flows through the tract, creating a lush riparian area with tall cottonwood trees and willows. Other historic Harrisburg structures, terraced gardens, an orchard, fields outlined by native rock walls, irrigation ditches, and wagon roads are preserved on the property.  Students and faculty from USU documented the features of this still-intact 19th century agrarian landscape, as part of the first Historic American Landscape Survey conducted in Utah.  The final concept plan will integrate the Adams house with a system of linked hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails that connect to trails in the Red Cliffs Recreation Area, the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, and the nearby historic Silver Reef mining district.

Exploration parties were immediately sent by church leaders to identify locations suitable for colonization along the Old Spanish Trail, to gain political control of the most important travel corridor in the Intermountain West.   In October of 1847, Jefferson Hunt, who had served in the Mormon Battalion in California, led a group of 18 men, 130 pack mules, and a single wagon to southern California to buy cattle, seed grain, and other needed goods.   The party arrived in San Bernardino after 45 days of travel, having reportedly brought the first wagon over the Old Spanish Trail.  The success of this expedition encouraged others to follow, including large numbers of prospectors and merchants â€œrushingâ€\\u009d to the newly-discovered gold deposits at Sutterâ€™s Mill in northern California during the winter months when the passes of the high Sierras would be impassable.  Over time, the wagon road that developed was labeled on maps as the â€œOld Southern Roadâ€\\u009d, the â€œImmigrant Roadâ€\\u009d or the â€œOld Mormon Roadâ€\\u009d.    By the first decade of the 20th century, early automobiles were traveling this same route and paved highways eventually replaced the wagon ruts.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://storage.needpix.com/thumbs/wagon-48633_1280.png\",\n            \"lat\": 37.058297,\n            \"location\": \"Utah\",\n            \"lon\": -113.306473,\n            \"natpark\": \"Zion\",\n            \"num_activities\": 1,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"126\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"16461\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Old-Mormon-Wagon-Road\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"PHOTOGRAPHY\",\n            \"description\": \"The Honeymoon Trail During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a primitive wagon road was the principle travel route between the Mormon settlements in northeastern Arizona and southern Utah.   In the late 1870s, Mormon colonists had been sent by church leaders to pioneer new settlements along Arizonaâ€™s Little Colorado River.  As the new settlements were remote and isolated, many goods and services could only be obtained from the established Mormon communities of southern Utah.   After 1877, the Arizona Mormon settlers also traveled to St. George, Utah to conduct church business and have their marriage vows solemnized in the newly-completed St. George Temple.  So many newlyweds traveled the wagon road that it came to be known as â€œthe Honeymoon Trailâ€\\u009d.Couples would travel in small groups for safety and companionship to make this long-distance trek across the varied and rugged terrain of northeastern Arizona and southwestern Utah.   This journey typically began in mid-November and required many weeks of hard travel to complete.   The wagons jolted across deep dry washes and slick rock, bogged down in deep sandy soils, and became mired in muddy stream crossings.   At Leeâ€™s Ferry, John D. Lee and his wife Emma provided regular ferry service for travelers, at one of the few feasible crossings of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.   Their journey then took them to Kanab, Utah, south to Pipe Springs, Arizona, finally heading north into Washington County.  Here, the Honeymoon Trail followed Fort Pearce Wash and headed north through the Warner Valley into St. George.  The spring at the historic Fort Pearce site was a popular overnight camping spot for these travelers, some of whom inscribed their names and the dates of their visits on the rocky cliff faces at the spring.   After their marriage ceremonies, the newlyweds would often spend the winter months in St. George, enjoying the social activities of this established community and purchasing needed supplies.  They began the long trip home in the early spring.  The Honeymoon Trail continued in use well into the 20th century, when modern highways were finally constructed across northeastern Arizona.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://c.pxhere.com/photos/5c/c0/coast_cliff_sky_mecklenburg_holstein_beach_sea_baltic_sea-611860.jpg!d\",\n            \"lat\": 37.058373,\n            \"location\": \"Utah\",\n            \"lon\": -113.306355,\n            \"natpark\": \"Zion\",\n            \"num_activities\": 1,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"126\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"16454\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Honeymoon-Trail\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"WILDERNESS\",\n            \"description\": \"<br>The Blackridge Wilderness now contains a total of 13,015 acres and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management.

Smack dab in the middle of the Mississippi Flyway, 43,500-acre Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge provides a winter feeding and resting area for an average of 40,000 Canada geese each year. Agriculture and logging in the early 1900s so depleted this region of forest, wetland, and grassland that wildlife could barely subsist here. The refuge was formed in 1947 to restore an adequate ground for geese, ducks, wild turkeys, a multitude of white-tailed deer, and small mammals including coyotes, beavers, opossums, and raccoons. Five thousand acres of the refuge are planted each year to feed wildfowl. Most people visit the refuge to bird-watch, hunt, and fish. Anglers cast a line for bass, bluegill, and crappie on Crab Orchard Lake, Devil's Kitchen Lake, Little Grassy Lake, and many smaller lakes. The Wilderness forms the southern tip of the refuge and encompasses sections of Little Grassy Lake and Devil's Kitchen Lake. Several parking lots and boat launches provide easy access to the water. Within Crab Orchard Wilderness boundaries lie dramatic sandstone outcroppings, wood-lined creeks, and potential seclusion, but there are no maintained trails. Camping is restricted to designated campsites, of which there are none in the Wilderness area (except for preexisting camps for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts).\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/10/06/02/21/apple-59905_960_720.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 37.71958,\n            \"location\": \"Illinois\",\n            \"lon\": -89.021164,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 1,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"12800\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Crab-Orchard-Wilderness\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"WILDERNESS\",\n            \"description\": \"<br>The Breton Wilderness now contains a total of 5,000 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Service's <a href=\\\"http://www.fws.gov/breton/\\\">Breton National Wildlife Refuge</a>.

Located off the delta of the great Mississippi River, Breton Island actually consists of two adjacent islands (north and south) with a combined length of about three miles and a width of less than one mile. Part of a long chain of barrier islands, they comprise only a small section of Breton National Wildlife Refuge. The greater portion of the refuge consists of the Chandeleur Islands, an approximately 20-mile-long crescent of land lying north of Breton. Between Breton and Chandeleur are more islands owned by the state and managed by the refuge. Geologically young, these unstable islands were created by the erosion and reshaping of a former Mississippi River delta. On the Gulf of Mexico side of the islands you'll find low sandy beaches tapering into a maze of ponds, inlets, and saltwater marshes. Hundreds of thousands of seabirds use these islands as nesting and wintering habitat. Endangered brown pelicans have made a dramatic return under careful refuge management. Camping is not allowed. Human visitors are common, sometimes coming for bird watching but primarily for surf fishing.

On the southern end of the Mississippi and Central Flyways, Lacassine National Wildlife Refuge is primarily a freshwater marsh. Lacassine refuge marshes provide feeding and resting habitat for more than 300,000 ducks and 80,000 geese. The refuge also provides habitat for many shorebirds, wading birds, marsh birds, various manmmals,and alligators. The first nesting colony of cattle egrets outside Florida was discovered here.

As recently as 1958, this area was an extension of the mainland, the eroding shoreline at the elbow of Cape Cod. Severe winter storms isolated Monomoy Point from the mainland and, 20 years later, separated North Monomoy Island from South Monomoy Island. Ten miles of surf-beaten dunes on the eastern shore of the islands, still-shifting sands that sometimes reach 100 feet in height, give way to salt marsh and then to mudflats on the western shore. The ecosystem is a perfect habitat for migratory birds. Dubbed a sanctuary for wildlife in 1944, most of 7,604-acre Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge has been designated Wilderness: all of the north island and all but two tracts on the south island. The mainland portion of the refuge remains non-Wilderness. People are known to have lived here from 1711 on, and a lighthouse complex on the south island attests to their presence.

In 1984, to posthumously honor a New Jersey conservationist congressman, Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge (established in 1939) and Barnegat National Wildlife Refuge (established in 1967) were combined to create the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge. Although the refuge consists of more than 39,000 acres, less than 7,000 acres in the southern division (the Brigantine) qualify as Wilderness. This trailless area, a tidal wetland and shallow bay habitat, is one of the most active flyways for migratory waterbirds in North America. Birdwatchers, binoculars in hand, have zoomed in on close to 300 species, including Atlantic brant and American black duck. The Wilderness also protects Holgate and Little Beaches, two of the few remaining barrier beaches in New Jersey. Grasses on these shores stabilize the fragile dunes and safeguard the rare piping plover, black skimmer, and least tern. The refuge is open during daylight hours, but there are prohibitions on camping, fires, horses, kite flying, swimming, flower picking, or anything else that might endanger the wildlife and their habitat.

Roughly 25,000 years ago, where the Wisconsin Glacier reached its furthest point south and stopped, the creation of Great Swamp began. With cattail marshes, wet meadows, swamp woodlands, and ridges thick with oak, beech, and laurel, Great Swamp provides a home for 39 species of mammals including mice, moles, skunks, raccoons, otters, foxes, white-tailed deer, and the endangered Indiana bat. Migratory birds see Great Swamp as a \\\"nest and rest\\\" (244 species have been identified). Numerous reptiles and amphibians have taken up residence, including rare bog turtles, wood turtles, and blue-spotted salamanders. The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1960 following grassroots action to save the area from being developed into a major metropolitan airport. In 1968, the eastern half of the Refuge was designated as the very first Wilderness Area within the Department of the Interior. About 8.5 miles of primitive trails provide access during daylight hours only, and camping and picnicking are not permitted.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://pixnio.com/free-images/nature-landscapes/wetlands-and-swamps/great-dismal-swamp-national-wildlife-refuge-300x225.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 40.719296,\n            \"location\": \"New-Jersey\",\n            \"lon\": -74.525859,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 1,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"12804\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Great-Swamp-National-Wildlife-Refuge-Wilderness\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS\",\n            \"description\": \"Originally known as the Oklahoma Bat Caves National Wildlife Refuge, Ozark Plateau NWR was established for the protection of endangered bats and their habitat.

Visitation is estimated at roughly 500 people per year.  There are about 5 miles of shoreline, 4 of which are open to recreation.  No water contact activities are allowed.  Average elevation is about 5,400 feet above sea level.  The site has only primitivefacilities and no on-site manager or law enforcement.In the spring, Fruitgrowers Reservoir wildlife viewing area offers a spectacular sight with thousands of sandhill cranes stopping over on their way north.  The reservoir hosts the largest nesting colony of western grebes in Colorado and more than 200 species of birds have been sighted.  Also, a variety of mammals (i.e., mule deer, fox, mink) and reptiles make the area their home.  There is a hard-surface watchable wildlife trail, about 750 feet long with turnout.

Kemple was an experienced prospector, and in 1868 he found a mineralized sandstone float (an ore unattached to the bedrock) that assayed very high in silver, but he had a hard time pinpointing its source. He returned in 1870, and discovered silver in the White Reef, at the Southern base of Pine Valley Mountain. But because the silver was in sandstone, which at the time was considered impossible, assayers were skeptical of his findings, which slowed the process for locating the source of his supplies. In 1874, John Kemple took the lead in organizing a new mining district called the Harrisburg Mining District, and Orson B. Adams was elected president. The first claim recorded within this district, was only about 300 hundred yards southwest from the Orson Adams House and was named Pride of the West Ledge and Kemple Company. Two years later, by early 1876, a surge of silver fever took off, and miners, along with supporting industries, flowed into the area.With the closest railroad a 100 miles away in Milford, on-site transformation of silver ore into bullion was crucial. The nearest mills were more than 300 miles away, so it was decided to build mills near the mines, process the ore, and then ship finished bullion to the railroad by wagon. Three of the five mills were built in Silver Reef, with one in Leeds and the other on the Virgin River, named Stormont Mill. Mines that would not pay before the mills came were now considered valuable property. During 1876, Silver Reef was one of the largest towns in Washington County, with about 1,500 residents. A development boom took place along mile-long Main Street, including the construction of 6 saloons, 9 grocery stores, 2 dance halls, a brewery, a billiard hall, the Wells Fargo Express Office, a jail, and a church, amongst many others. St. John Catholic Church was Southern Utahâ€™s first established Catholic congregation, founded in 1879, which housed the townâ€™s hospital in a rear wing. Only remnants of the church can still be seen. Town advocates wanted Silver Reef to become the county seat, but the more conservative citizens of neighboring towns, established by members of the LDS church, were against it.  As a typical boomtown, Silver Reef grew as quickly as it dwindled down. Reduced operations continued through 1909, after which mining completely stopped, and livestock owners took their place. When the town went extinct, neighboring town residents burrowed the leftover buildings and took the materials for their own use.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed-206.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 37.252778,\n            \"location\": \"Utah\",\n            \"lon\": -113.367778,\n            \"natpark\": \"Zion\",\n            \"num_activities\": 1,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"126\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"16459\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Silver-Reef-Mining-District\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"WILDERNESS\",\n            \"description\": \"<br>The Blackbeard Island Wilderness now contains a total of 3,000 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Service.

The Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness is bordered by the Cottonwood Forest Wilderness to the north.The approximately 11,700 acre Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness is within the newly-designated Red Cliffs National Conservation Area and shares a common boundary with the Cottonwood Forest Wilderness, located on the Dixie National Forest. Here, massive blocks of Jurassic age Navajo Sandstone have been eroded by wind and water, leaving rounded domes and numerous small canyons. The resulting landscape is both austere and intimate, affording outstanding opportunities for solitude and natural quiet, just minutes away from the major population centers of Washington County. Convenient trail access makes this wilderness a popular choice for hikers and equestrians. Visit the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area web page for more information about trails in the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness.  Although it is at the western edge of the Colorado Plateau, the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness supports plant and animals species that typify the arid Mojave Desert. Pockets of desert shrubs cover the sand dunes and rocky outcrops of this wilderness. Mojave Desert species, such as Utah agave, banana yucca, scrub oak , and single-leaf ash, are found in the lowlands and line the dry washes. At higher elevations, pinyon pine and Utah juniper dot the rocky slopes of the wilderness area. Mule deer, mountain lion, bobcat, and kit fox live here, as they do farther east on the Colorado Plateau. Mojave Desert species, including the federally-listed threatened Mojave Desert tortoise and the Gila monster and chuckwalla reptiles are also residents of the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness. Golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, and the western screen owl circle the craggy canyons of this wilderness area, searching for prey. On the right day, at the right time, lucky visitors may see bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and Cooper's, and sharp-shinned hawks in the area.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://get.pxhere.com/photo/landscape-water-nature-outdoor-wilderness-mountain-sky-sunshine-sun-hiking-photography-lake-adventure-mountain-range-stone-summer-hike-scenery-blue-reservoir-body-of-water-rocks-sandy-sunny-trekking-utah-fell-loch-mountainous-landforms-bell-canyon-reservoir-bells-canyon-little-cottonwood-canyon-1407400.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 37.22584333,\n            \"location\": \"Utah\",\n            \"lon\": -113.4078228,\n            \"natpark\": \"Zion\",\n            \"num_activities\": 0,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"126\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"16302\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Cottonwood-Canyon-Wilderness\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"\",\n            \"description\": \"Taylor Creek Wilderness is located adjacent to the Kolob Canyons region of Zion National Park.

The northern half of Parunuweap is heavily wooded with pinyon and juniper with a jeep trail leading down into the canyon. This route should only be taken by people experienced in driving on rough mountain roads. The main landmarks in and directly south of the southern portion of the WSA are Harris Mountain and Elephant Butte. Again, springs and plant life concentrate animals in the area. Mule deer are common, and with the mule deer come predatory mountain lions. Many kinds of hawks, eagles and other birds can also be seen in the area. Beware, however, since rattlesnakes are also common here. Special Features: A major historical feature is the Elephant Gap or Foote Ranch Road, believed to follow the pioneer route between Pipe Spring, Arizona, and Long Valley, Utah. About 4.5 miles of this route are cherry-stemmed from the WSA and 4 miles are considered to be a way within the WSA.   The state sensitive bald eagle occasionally roosts in the WSA in the winter.   The peregrine falcon may nest within the WSA.   The golden eagle may also sometimes inhabit or nest in the WSA.   Other state sensitive or USFWS candidate or threatened animal species that may inhabit the WSA include ferruginous hawk, Mexican spotted owl, western yellow-billed cuckoo, and Bell's vireo.

It contains a great diversity of habitats, notably: northern forest valuable as nesting habitat for migrant thrushes, warblers and other birds; rivers and streams used by shad, salmon, herring and other migratory fishes; and an internationally significant complex of high-quality tidal fresh, brackish and salt marshes.    \\t&lt;P&gt;    \\tThe refuge works in partnership with a wide variety of individuals and organizations to provide environmental education, to encourage and support appropriate habitat conservation and management on public and private lands, and to protect additional habitat.    \\t&lt;P&gt;    \\tThe refuge has three cooperative visitor centers: in Colebrook, New Hampshire; at the Montshire Museum of Science in Norwich, Vermont; and Great Falls Discovery Center near the headquarters in Turners Falls, Massachusetts.  The Refuge currently consists of seven Units (small tracts) and two Divisions (large tracts)parcels: 33 acres of wetlands and a riverine sand spit that hosts a federally-listed beetle in Cromwell, Connecticut; a 4 acre island in Deerfield, Massachusetts; 30 acres at the base of Mt. Toby in Sunderland, Massachusetts; an 18 acre upland and wetland parcel in Westfield, Massachusetts; 140 acres on Mt. Tom in Holyoke, Massachusetts; 20 acres along the river in Greenfield, Massachusetts; 278 acres which host a federally endangered plant in Putney, Vermont; 3,670 acres surrounding the.

The reservoir has approximately  4,407 water surface acres, 4,546 land acres and 42 miles of shoreline. Recreation on this reservoir is managed by the SD Department of Game, Fish and Parks for the Bureau of Reclamation and includes campgrounds, boat ramps, fishing pier and a marina.  Fish species include walleye, bass, northern pike, perch, bluegill, and crappie.Because the reservoir is located on the southeastern edge of the Black Hills and is the only large body of water in an isolated area of arid southwestern South Dakota, it is attractive to migrating waterbirds that follow the eastern edge of the Black Hills.

Numerous reptiles and amphibians have taken up residence, including rare bog turtles, wood turtles, and blue-spotted salamanders. The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1960 following grassroots action to save the area from being developed into a major metropolitan airport. In 1968, the eastern half of the Refuge was designated as the very first Wilderness Area within the Department of the Interior.

Severe winter storms isolated Monomoy Point from the mainland and, 20 years later, separated North Monomoy Island from South Monomoy Island. Ten miles of surf-beaten dunes on the eastern shore of the islands, still-shifting sands that sometimes reach 100 feet in height, give way to salt marsh and then to mudflats on the western shore. The ecosystem is a perfect habitat for migratory birds.

This facility contains interactive exhibits, displays, a sales area, classrooms for speciel events, and knowledgeable people where visitors can come and explore the refuges and learn about the wildlife resources and coastal environments of each refuge. Refuge lands on Block Island are most notable for the large concentration (over 70 species) of migratory songbirds which visit the area each fall.  Located in the Atlantic flyway, many young, inexperienced songbirds \\\"overfly\\\" the mainland and stopover on Block Island before continuing their migration.  The result is a cornucopia of young migratory songbirds from a variety of  different species.

When restored, Emiquon will provide quality backwater lake, bottomland forest, upland forest, prairie, seasonal wetland, and marsh habitat for migratory birds, fish, and resident wildlife. An additional 1,100 acres will be retained for agricultural crops for wildlife. Emiquon Refuge is part of the Illinois River National Wildlife Refuge Complex, with headquarters at Chautauqua Refuge, in Havana, Illinois.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://pixnio.com/free-images/nature-landscapes/national-parks-reserves/emiquon-national-reserve-300x196.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 40.361926,\n            \"location\": \"Illinois\",\n            \"lon\": -89.845102,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 5,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1389\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Emiquon-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"AUTO-TOURING,HISTORIC-&-CULTURAL-SITE,INTERPRETIVE-PROGRAMS,FISHING,HIKING,HUNTING,VISITOR-CENTER,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION,PHOTOGRAPHY\",\n            \"description\": \"Erie National Wildlife Refuge is located in Crawford County, 35 miles south of the City of Erie and 10 miles east of Meadville on the outskirts of Guys Mills village.

The district includes Barron, Burnett, Dunn, Washburn, Pierce, Pepin, Polk, and St. Croix counties.  The central portion of St. Croix County, the heart of the district, is known as the Star Prairie Pothole Grasslands.  These grasslands are ranked sixth out of 26 priority grassland landscapes in Wisconsin. The district manages relatively small tracts of prairie wetland and grassland habitats known as waterfowl production areas (WPAs).  WPAs are purchased using Federal Duck Stamp dollars within the historic prairie pothole portion of the district, including southern Polk, St. Croix and Dunn counties.  After purchase, prairie wetland and grassland habitats are restored and then managed for breeding waterfowl, other migratory birds, and indigenous wildlife. The district's 40 WPAs totaling 7,000 acres are administered by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wildlife Refuge System. In addition to managing WPAs, district staff provide assistance to private landowners who wish to manage their land to benefit wildlife. The St. Croix Wetland Management District is adjacent to the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropoitan Area of two million people.  St. Croix County is the second fastest growing county in Wisconsin and has the highest per capita income.

It is an isolated backwater, cut off from the Mississippi and Trempealeau rivers by dikes, providing needed resting and feeding areas for waterfowl and other birds.        The refuge is situated in a unique geological formation known as the driftless area.  Thousands of years ago,    glaciers surrounded but did not pass over the land.  Blown into mounds, sand and silt from melting glaciers     formed the rolling sand prairies of the refuge.        Wetlands are a prominent feature.  Before the railroads arrived and the locks and dams were built,    the lands within the refuge were part of the Mississippi River.  As such, these backwaters experienced floods and     droughts.  Today, using dikes and control structures, managers can mimic this natural cycle by lowering the water    to expose mudflats and allow plants to germinate.

Approximately half of the refuge consists of aquatic habitats including bay with marine seagrass beds, intertidal saltmarsh, high saltmarsh, freshwater marsh, shrub swamp, and red maple swamp. The refuge's saltmarshes, combined with the adjacent New York State-owned saltmarsh, form the largest continuous saltmarsh on Long Island.         The remaining half of the refuge is upland featuring the rare Pine Barren habitats of pitch pine, oak-pine, mixed oak, pioneer hardwood, upland shrub, and grasslands.          The refuge's wildlife populations are quite diverse.  About 300 species of birds have been documented at Wertheim. The refuge winters up to 5,000 waterfowl, the majority being black ducks - a species in nationwide decline. The coastal location also makes this refuge an excellent migration corridor for shorebirds, raptors and songbirds.         The main purpose for establishing the refuge was to protect the Carmans River Estuary for migratory birds.  The River is a NY State-designated Wild and Scenic river and one of the Island's largest.

In fact, the 20 mile upstream section of the Genesee River is safe guarded by the Genesee River Protection Act of 1989, which allows the dam to hold back water only to prevent flooding. Typically, the Genesee flows freely through the dam without interference. However, when the dam is preventing flooding, the water backs up to fill Letchworth Canyon until it can be released at a rate that will not cause flooding downstream.     Mount Morris Dam and Recreation Area is a day use park that offers a beautiful setting overlooking Letchworth Canyon, known as the \\\"Grand Canyon of the East\\\".  Explore the Visitor Center to learn more about the dam or join us for a free ranger guided walking tour of the Mount Morris Dam.  Spend time outside on the park grounds to enjoy captivating overlooks, picnic shelters, and a playground.  This is a great place to hike, bike, or view wildlife.  During the winter, explore the trails on snowshoes or cross country skis.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5489/14561190446_05da979187_b.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 42.697733,\n            \"location\": \"New-York\",\n            \"lon\": -77.905869,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 7,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"130\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"1821\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Mount-Morris-Dam-and-Recreation-Area\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BOATING,CAMPING,FISHING,HIKING,PICNICKING,WATER-SPORTS,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PLAYGROUND-PARK-SPECIALIZED-SPORT-SITE,OTHER-RECREATION-CONCESSION-SITE,ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION\",\n            \"description\": \"This Corps project located near the New York state line in North Central Pennsylvania provides a 1,085-acre lake with 17 miles of shoreline for use by campers and day trippers.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5-S3KylWamg/UfavW4Xu0jI/AAAAAAAAVAc/lGM4SuwGSK0/s0/IMG_20130729_103117_189.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 41.987571,\n            \"location\": \"Pennsylvania\",\n            \"lon\": -77.174245,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 10,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"130\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"184\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Cowanesque-Lake\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"BOATING,CAMPING,FISHING,HIKING,HORSEBACK-RIDING,PICNICKING,WINTER-SPORTS,WATER-SPORTS,WILDLIFE-VIEWING,PLAYGROUND-PARK-SPECIALIZED-SPORT-SITE,HOTEL/LODGE/RESORT-PRIVATELY-OWNED\",\n            \"description\": \"The recreation area at this central Pennsylvania lake is operated and maintained by Clearfield County.

River channelization, wetland drainage, and conversion of river bottom floodplain areas to agricultural, industrial, and municipal uses had resulted in the loss of over 500,000 acres of habitat along the navigable stretch of the Missouri River floodplain. The Boyer Chute project is a joint Federal and local conservation partnership success story. The project has restored the area to near pre-channelization condition without affecting navigation on the main stem of the Missouri River. Boyer Chute is once again a functioning part of the river. Close to 3,350 acres of floodplain woodland, tallgrass prairie, and wetland habitats now benefit Missouri River fishes, migratory birds, endangered species, and resident wildlife. Boyer Chute is self guiding. Floods in 2011 changed the look and the habitats of the refuge. The north and south sections of the auto tour loop are open.  The Sauger Fishing Pier along the south section of road is open, but the Catfish Fishing Pier just south of the Refuge Entrance will remain closed indefinitely.

Common wetland plants include: Virginia chain fern, cranberry, sphagnum moss, broad-leaved cattail, and common reed.\",\n            \"imglink\": \"https://pixnio.com/free-images/nature-landscapes/national-parks-reserves/chincoteague-national-wildlife-refuge.jpg\",\n            \"lat\": 41.256099,\n            \"location\": \"Massachusetts\",\n            \"lon\": -70.818035,\n            \"natpark\": \"N/A\",\n            \"num_activities\": 0,\n            \"par_org_id\": \"127\",\n            \"rec_id\": \"4060\",\n            \"rec_name\": \"Nomans-Land-Island-National-Wildlife-Refuge\",\n            \"reservable\": true,\n            \"stay_limit\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"activities\": \"\",\n            \"description\": \"Assabet River NWR, formerly referred to as the U.S. Army's Fort Devens Sudbury Training Annex, is a 2,230-acre parcel of land located approximately 25 miles west of Boston, and 4 miles west of the Eastern Massachusetts NWR Complex Headquarters. It is located in portions of the Towns of Hudson, Maynard, Stow and Sudbury and covers approximately 3.5 square miles. The Assabet River NWR consists of two separate pieces of land. The larger northern section is just north of Hudson Road. The southern section is located to the south of Hudson Road. The refuge is comprised of a diverse mixture of pine/hardwood forest, old field, and wetland habitats. On March 26, 2005, the refuge officially opened for wildlife dependent recreation. As of November 13, 2005, there are 10 miles of trails open to the public for wildlife observation. A map of existing trails is available at the kiosk on Hudson Road in Sudbury and at the refuge website.  The refuge is also open for hunting and will open for fishing in Spring 2006. Dogs are not allowed on the refuge. The Friends of the Assabet River NWR formed in 2000, nearly a full year prior to the transfer of the U.S. Army's former Fort Devens Sudbury Training Annex to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Since that time, the Friends Group has provided the refuge invaluable assistance in preparing to open the refuge for wildlife-dependent recreational activities by removing physical safety hazards; conducting biological surveys of vernal pools, raptors, bats, invasive plant species; and conducting numerous public outreach and education programs.
